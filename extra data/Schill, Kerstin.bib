abstract={Algorithms for controlling fully autonomous systems must meet especially high requirements with respect to safety and robustness. A particularly challenging example are autonomous deep space missions, which we investigated in several projects. In this context, we showed that a safe and robust autonomous system can be realized through nonlinear model predictive control approaches using optimization techniques in combination with multi-sensor fusion based on an extended representation of uncertainty. The focus of this paper is on demonstrating the versatility of that concept by transferring the corresponding algorithms to the also very challenging application of autonomous driving. In particular, we propose a system concept for a self-driving car based on our methodology. Furthermore, we present results of a real world research vehicle that autonomously explores a parking lot, dynamically takes obstacles into account, and finally performs a parking maneuver. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Keeping track of the current state is a crucial task for mobile autonomous systems, which is referred to as state estimation. To solve that task, information from all available sensors needs to be fused, which includes relative measurements as well as observations of the surroundings. In a dynamic 3D environment, the pose of an agent has to be chosen such that the most relevant information can be observed. We propose an approach for multi-sensor fusion and active perception within an autonomous deep space navigation scenario. The probabilistic modeling of observables and sensors for that particular domain is described. For state estimation, we present an Extended Kalman Filter, an Unscented Kalman Filter, and a Particle Filter, which all operate on a manifold state space. Additionally, an approach for active perception is proposed, which selects the desired attitude of the spacecraft based on the knowledge about the dynamics of celestial objects, the kind of information they provide as well as the current uncertainty of the filters. We evaluated the localization performance of the algorithms within a simulation environment. The filters are compared to each other and we show that our active perception strategy outperforms two other information intake approaches. © 2018 ISIF},

abstract={The data collected by the Cassini spacecraft provide strong evidence for the existence of liquid water under the ice-covered surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus. For that reason, it is currently one of the most promising candidates to find extraterrestrial life in our solar system. The Enceladus Explorer (EnEx) initiative of the German Aerospace Center proposes a concept for a lander mission to probe that moon for life, which uses one maneuverable melting probe to retrieve a sample from the sub-glacial water reservoir as well as multiple smaller melting probes as navigation aids. In addition to technical challenges, a major prerequisite for the success of that mission is the ability to autonomously navigate through the ice of Enceladus. We present an integrated system for multi-sensor fusion, high-level planning and autonomous decision making, as well as trajectory optimization and optimal control, which aims to solve that challenging task. The sensor fusion module is responsible for localizing the probes as well as creating a map of the environment. It uses an approach based on graph optimization techniques, which simultaneously estimates the position and attitude of all probes in 3-dimensional space. For mapping, an extended formalism for representing uncertainty is utilized, which allows one to distinguish between different causes of uncertainty. Based on that information, the autonomy module decides on the further course of action. It creates a high-level plan in order to reach the mission goal or sub-goals, e.g., improving the localization by taking further measurements. In addition, autonomous fault detection is performed, and if required, the system's behavior is adapted in order to compensate for degraded components or unexpected situations. For realizing the high-level plan, the guidance module computes a trajectory in consideration of different optimality criteria. Finally, a model predictive control algorithm generates and applies the corresponding control commands and ensures a reliable tracking of that trajectory. Both trajectory planning and control take information provided by the sensor fusion into account. Furthermore, in order to cope with the high degree of uncertainty regarding environmental conditions, the model of the system dynamics is improved by means of automated parameter identification and adaption. In addition to a description of our system, we present preliminary results from a field test campaign on a European glacier with the entire EnEx system.

abstract={We present a multi-sensor fusion approach based on an extended Kalman filter for estimating position and attitude in 3-dimensional space. The corresponding state is represented by a manifold that allows for a robust and mathematically consistent estimation of the state and uncertainty. The filter is used for navigating a maneuverable melting probe through deep ice, which is designed for in-situ sample analysis missions to icy bodies of our solar system. It is equipped with a variety of sensors for inertial navigation and absolute positioning that account for the fact that no global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can be used. The probe and navigation technologies were successfully tested on European and Antarctic glaciers. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to a particle filter approach in different simulated and real-world scenarios. © 2016 ISIF.},

abstract={The Saturnian moon Enceladus with its extensive water bodies underneath a thick ice sheet cover is a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life. Direct exploration of such extraterrestrial aquatic ecosystems requires advanced access and sampling technologies with a high level of autonomy. A new technological approach has been developed as part of the collaborative research project Enceladus Explorer (EnEx). The concept is based upon a minimally invasive melting probe called the IceMole. The force-regulated, heater-controlled IceMole is able to travel along a curved trajectory as well as upwards. Hence, it allows maneuvers which may be necessary for obstacle avoidance or target selection. Maneuverability, however, necessitates a sophisticated on-board navigation system capable of autonomous operations. The development of such a navigational system has been the focal part of the EnEx project. The original IceMole has been further developed to include relative positioning based on in-ice attitude determination, acoustic positioning, ultrasonic obstacle and target detection integrated through a high-level sensor fusion. This paper describes the EnEx technology and discusses implications for an actual extraterrestrial mission concept. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The human visual system exhibits substantially different properties between foveal and peripheral vision. Peripheral vision is special in that it has to compress data onto fewer units by reduced visual acuity and larger receptive fields, yielding greatly reduced performance on many tasks such as object recognition. However, here we show that the pooling operations implemented by peripheral vision provide exactly the invariance properties required by a self-localization task. We test the effect of different pooling sizes, as well as acuity reduction, on localization, object recognition, and scene categorization tasks. We find that peripheral pooling, but not reduced acuity, affects localization performance positively, whereas it is detrimental to object recognition performance.},

abstract={When an autonomous system has to act in or interact with an environment, a suitable representation of it is required. In the past decades, many different representation forms - especially spacial ones - have been proposed and even more information fusion techniques were developed in order to build these representations from multiple information sources. However, most of these algorithms do not exploit the full potential of the available information. This is caused by the fact that they are not able to handle the full complexity of all possible solutions compatible with the information and that they rely on restrictive assumptions (i.e. independencies) in order to make the computation feasible. In this work, a new methodology is envisioned that utilizes formal methods, in particular solvers for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, to drop some of these assumptions. In order to illustrate the ideas, information fusion based on belief functions and occupancy grid maps are considered. It is shown that this approach allows for considering dependencies among multiple cells and thus significantly reduces the uncertainty in the resulting representation. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={One major objective of autonomous systems navigating in dynamic environments is gathering information needed for self localization, decision making, and path planning. To account for this, such systems are usually equipped with multiple types of sensors. As these sensors often have a limited field of view and a fixed orientation, the task of active perception breaks down to the problem of calculating alignment sequences which maximize the information gain regarding expected measurements. Action sequences that rotate the system according to the calculated optimal patterns then have to be generated. In this paper we present an approach for calculating these sequences for an autonomous system equipped with multiple sensors. We use a particle filter for multi- sensor fusion and state estimation. The planning task is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the system decides in each step, what actions to perform next. The optimal control policy, which provides the best action depending on the current estimated state, maximizes the expected cumulative reward. The latter is computed from the expected information gain of all sensors over time using value iteration. The algorithm is applied to a manifold representation of the joint space of rotation and time. We show the performance of the approach in a spacecraft navigation scenario where the information gain is changing over time, caused by the dynamic environment and the continuous movement of the spacecraft. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={It is often assumed that humans represent large-scale spatial environments as cognitive maps, but the exact features of these representations are still unclear. We investigate the structure of this representation with the impossible worlds paradigm by testing whether the information provided by virtual environments (VEs) with arbitrary violations of geometrical rules is rectified (“distorted”) to become compatible with a map-like structure. The experiments were conducted in virtual reality using a natural locomotion interface. The subjects’ task was to explore possible and impossible VEs carefully to achieve a “full understanding”. After each trial, they had to “blindly” reproduce the path through the environment from memory in a VE with impoverished visual cues. We have found no evidence for angular or configurational distortions or alterations in the blind reproductions of impossible VEs. Blind reproduction indicates that impossible VEs do not require a transformation into a “possible” format to make them fit into the cognitive map. This suggests that the representation may not be similar to a map in a bounded sense of interpretation but requires more generalized concepts for its understanding. © 2015, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The interaction of biological agents within the real world is based on their abilities and the affordances of the environment. By contrast, the classical view of perception considers only sensory features, as do most object recognition models. Only a few models make use of the information provided by the integration of sensory information as well as possible or executed actions. Neither the relations shaping such an integration nor the methods for using this integrated information in appropriate representations are yet entirely clear. We propose a probabilistic model integrating the two information sources in one system. The recognition process is equipped with an utility maximization principle to obtain optimal interactions with the environment © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Understanding the impact of interaction mechanics on the user’s emotional state can aid in shaping the user experience. For eliciting the emotional state of a user, designers and researchers typically employ subjective or expert assessment. Yet these methods are typically applied after the user has finished the interaction, causing a delay between stimulus and assessment. Physiological measures potentially offer more reliable indication of a user’s affective state in real-time. We present an experiment to increase our understanding of the relation of certain stimuli and valence of induced emotions in games. For this we designed a simple game to induce negative and positive emotions in the player. The results show a high correspondence between our classification of participants’ physiological signals and subjective assessment. However, creating a clear causality between game elements and emotions is a daunting task, and our designs offer room for improvement. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

abstract={This paper introduces an autonomous navigation concept based on optical observations of the Sun and selected planetary bodies. The concept is self-contained and independent from the mission ground segment. It enables autonomous navigation of spacecraft anywhere in the solar system, including spacecraft flying through the Asteroid Main Belt (AMB). Initially, the novel navigation concept is introduced within its historical and technological context. The sensor technology involved, the navigation observables and their accuracy is discussed. Subsequently, the navigation performance - i.e. position and velocity errors - is analysed for two selected orbit scenarios: an Earth-like orbit around the Sun and an orbit within the AMB at 2.8 AU from the Sun. For each test scenario two estimators are used: an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) accounting for third body gravitational perturbations and a Particle Filter (PF). The results are evaluated in terms of the standard deviations of the available measurements, the frequency of the observations and the number of observations simultaneously participating in the sensor fusion process. The optical navigation concept introduced here makes use of a coupled star-Sun tracker to determine direction to the Sun, optical Doppler measurements from a resonance-scattering interferometer to determine the spacecraft radial velocity relative to the Sun and optical cameras to determine the line-of-sight vector towards planetary bodies. The problem of orbit determination is solved at first for an orbital distance of 1 AU from the Sun. This initial test evaluates the benefits of the additional planetary line-of-sight observations as compared to previous concepts based on observations of the Sun only. In a second step, the two implementations based on the UKF and PF are compared with the purpose of evaluating the sensor fusion capability of the overall system. The UKF and the PF solutions are assessed in terms of accuracy of the positioning solution, convergence efficiency and computational requirements. Finally, the performance of the proposed concept is evaluated for the KaNaRiA mission scenario. KaNaRiA is a feasibility study of an asteroid mining mission targeting asteroids in the main belt. Part of the KaNaRiA mission architecture consists of several prospecting spacecraft which will fly autonomously to different target asteroids. In the context of the KaNaRiA mission analysis, a parking orbit at 2.8 AU from the Sun has been selected. The orbit is characterized by slow varying geometry relative to the Sun and good observability opportunities of the near planet Jupiter.},

abstract={Problems and the calculation of trajectory sensitivities for on-board stability analysis as well as real-time optimal control are explained. Bringing cognitive autonomy to a spacecraft requires an on-board computational module as a central spacecraft component. This module is responsible for state evaluation, mission planning and decision-making regarding selection of potential targets, trajectory selection and FD1R. A knowledge-base serves as a database for decision making processes. With the aim to validate and test our methods, we create a virtual environment in which humans can interact with the simulation of the mission. In order to achieve real-time performance, we propose a massively-parallel software system architecture, which enables very efficient and easily adaptable communication between concurrent software modules within KaNaRiA.,With the rapid evolution of space technologies and increasing thirst for knowledge about the origin of life and the universe, the need for deep space missions as well as for autonomous solutions for complex, time-critical mission operations becomes urgent. Within this context, the project KaNaRiA aims at technology development tailored to the ambitious task of space resource mining on small planetary bodies using increased autonomy for on-board mission planning, navigation and guidance. This paper focuses on the specific challenges as well as first solutions and results corresponding to the KaNaRiA mission phases (1) interplanetary cruise, (2) target identification and characterization and (3) proximity operations. Based on the KaNaRiA asteroid mining mission objectives, initially, a mission reference scenario as well as a reference mission architecture are described in this paper. KaNaRiA has been proposed as a multi-spacecraft mission to the asteroid main belt. Composed of a flock of prospective scout spacecraft, a mother ship carrying the mining payload and several service modules placed on a 2.8 AU parking orbit around the Sun, KaNaRiA intends to characterize main belt asteroid properties, identify targets for mining and perform a soft-landing for in-situ characterization and mining. Subsequently, the autonomous navigation system design of KaNaRiA for the interplanetary cruise is presented. The navigation challenges, which arise in phases (1) to (3), are discussed. Particular attention is given to the sensor- technology readiness-level, accuracy, applicability range, mass and power budgets. In order to navigate in the vicinity of an asteroid, an information fusion algorithm is required that aggregates multi-sensor data as well as a- priori knowledge and solves the task known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In order to deal with uncertain and inconsistent information and to explicitly represent different dimensions of uncertainty, a belief- function-based SLAM approach is used, which is a generalization of the popular FastSLAM algorithm. The objective of the guidance task is the autonomous planning of optimal transfer trajectories according to mission driving criteria, e.g. transfer time and fuel consumption.

abstract={This paper presents an object recognition approach based on belief function inference and information gain maximization. A common problem for probabilistic object recognition models is that the parameters of the probability distributions cannot be accurately estimated using the available training data due to high dimensionality. We therefore use belief functions in order to make the reliability of the evidence provided by the training data an explicit part of the recognition model. In contrast to typical classification approaches, we consider recognition as a sequential information-gathering process where a system with dynamic beliefs actively seeks to acquire new evidence. This acquisition process is based on the principle of maximum expected information gain and enables the system to perform optimal actions for reducing uncertainty as quickly as possible. We evaluate our system on a standard object recognition dataset where we investigate the effect of the amount of training data on classification performance by comparing different methods for constructing belief functions from data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Spatial interaction of biological agents with their environment is based on the cognitive processing of sensory as well as motor information. There are many models for sole sensory processing but only a few for integrating sensory and motor information into a unifying sensorimotor approach. Additionally, neither the relations shaping the integration are yet clear nor how the integrated information can be used in an underlying representation. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic model for integrated processing of sensory and motor information by combining bottom-up feature extraction and top-down action selection embedded in a Bayesian inference approach. The integration of sensory perceptions and motor information brings about two main advantages: (i) Their statistical dependencies can be exploited by representing the spatial relationships of the sensor information in the underlying joint probability distribution and (ii) a top-down process can compute the next most informative region according to an information gain strategy. We evaluated our system in two different object recognition tasks. We found that the integration of sensory and motor information significantly improves active object recognition, in particular when these movements have been chosen by an information gain strategy. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Inhibition of return (IOR) as an indicator of attentional control is characterized by an eccentricity effect, that is, the more peripheral visual field shows a stronger IOR magnitude relative to the perifoveal visual field. However, it could be argued that this eccentricity effect may not be an attention effect, but due to cortical magnification. To test this possibility, we examined this eccentricity effect in two conditions: the same-size condition in which identical stimuli were used at different eccentricities, and the size-scaling condition in which stimuli were scaled according to the cortical magnification factor (M-scaling), thus stimuli being larger at the more peripheral locations. The results showed that the magnitude of IOR was significantly stronger in the peripheral relative to the perifoveal visual field, and this eccentricity effect was independent of the manipulation of stimulus size (same-size or size-scaling). These results suggest a robust eccentricity effect of IOR which cannot be eliminated by M-scaling. Underlying neural mechanisms of the eccentricity effect of IOR are discussed with respect to both cortical and subcortical structures mediating attentional control in the perifoveal and peripheral visual field. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.},

abstract={Virtual reality systems provide a convenient means of studying human cognition and performance on a wide range of tasks for which real-world testing is cost prohibitive or difficult to control. For the results of such studies to be valid, it is important to ensure that aspects of the virtual experience do not alter a participant's behavior or performance on the experimental tasks. This can be particularly difficult when using novel locomotion interfaces that require training. Training procedures should not be completed until movement tasks can be performed at a high level of ability and they do not interfere with concurrent cognitive tasks. A study is described in which subjects were trained to locomote in the Virtusphere, an interface resembling a 'human-sized hamster ball.' The effectiveness of training is discussed in terms of both movement abilities and performance on a concurrent cognitive task. Movement performance was tracked as subjects learned to travel through a virtual environment. Additionally, subjects simultaneously completed cognitive tasks in a dual-task selective-interference paradigm. Results showed very rapid improvement on movement measures, including distance traveled and the ratio of collisions to distance traveled, with performance improvement becoming gradual within a few minutes. However, results also highlight persistent problems with concurrent spatial memory tasks, indicating that the training is not really done when performance on the movement metrics levels off. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={What are the ingredients required for vision-based place recognition? Pattern recognition models for localization must fulfill invariance requirements different from those of object recognition. We propose a method to evaluate the suitability of existing image processing techniques by testing their outputs against these invariances. The method is applied to several holistic and one local model. We generalize our findings and identify model properties of locality, spatial configuration and generalization as key factors for applicability to localization tasks.},

abstract={We are interested in a bio-inspired representation of space that can be used for the design of autonomous systems and assistive devices. Experiments with subjects navigating in physically impossible environments indicate that the basic human representation of space cannot be map-like. Rather, it seems to be sensorimotor in nature, combining sensory features with motor actions. We argue that such a sensorimotor representation is important for the design of artificial systems that have to deal with spatial data. Here we demonstrate that this refers to both autonomous sytems for spatial exploration and navigation and to systems for human assistance, in particular a navigation assistance and training system for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disorientation and getting lost behavior are early signs of AD in most patients. The proposed system will focus on cognitive deficits associated with the disease by using and training skills that are still likely to be intact in the individual person. By means of guiding the attention to salient and autobiographically important landmarks, and practicing routes between them, the system will help to build up and train a more resilient sensorimotor representation. The user interface focuses on combining the visual scenes of the incorporated landmarks with a simplified map of the surrounding area. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigated audiovisual interactions in motion perception by behavioral experiments testing both, the influence of visual stimuli on auditory apparent motion and the influence of auditory stimuli on visual apparent motion perception. A set of loudspeakers with an LED mounted in the middle of each speaker cone was arranged in a semicircle. Apparent motion streams were presented for each modality alone in the unimodal conditions. In the bimodal conditions, stimuli of the second modality were added to fill the temporal and spatial gaps of the sampled trajectory of the reference stream. The participants' task was to observe the quasi-naturalistic stimulus sequences and to perform a standard classification. The addition of stimuli of the second modality indeed facilitated apparent motion perception. Bimodal presentation increased the upper temporal interval up to which the stimuli could be separated in time while still being perceived as continuous motion. We interpret these results as evidence for an ecologically advantageous audiovisual motion integration mechanism which operates beyond the constraints of strict spatiotemporal coincidence. Functional considerations suggest that this mechanism may represent an amodal stage suited for the processing of both unimodal and bimodal signals. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={The "Intelligent Container" is a sensor network used for the management of logistic processes, especially for perishable goods such as fruit and vegetables. The system measures relevant parameters such as temperature and humidity. The concept of "cognitive systems" provides an adequate description of the complex supervision tasks and sensor data handling. The cognitive system can make use of several algorithms in order to estimate temperature related quality losses, detect malfunctioning sensors, and to control the sensor density and measurement intervals. Based on sensor data, knowledge about the goods, their history and the context, decentralized decision making is realized by decision support tools. The amount of communication between the container and the headquarters of the logistic company is reduced, while at the same time the quality of the process control is enhanced. The system is also capable of self-evaluation using plausibility checking of the sensor data. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports on our user modelling work based on an empirical study of users' behaviour while driving a power wheelchair with a safety assistant. The focus was on persons with visual perceptional deficits, who show deficits to control a power wheelchair safely if no additional assistance system is available. Our major concern is to identify users' behavioural patterns which lead to the intervention of the safety assistant, although the empirical study itself covers many different research aspects. The goal of the current work is twofold: to adapt the safety assistance for users with hemianopsia who lost one half of their visual field and to improve their navigation skill in narrow space via suitable interaction.},

abstract={Many tasks involve the precise estimation of speed and position of moving objects, for instance to catch or avoid objects that cohabit in our environment. Many of these objects are characterised by signal representations in more than one modality, such as hearing and vision. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual signals enhances the estimation of motion speed and instantaneous position. Observers are asked to estimate the instant when a moving object arrives at a target spatial position by pressing a response button. This task requires observers to estimate the speed of the moving object and to calibrate the timing of their manual response such that it coincides with the true arrival time of the moving object. When both visual and auditory motion signals are available, the variability in estimating the arrival time of the moving object is significantly reduced compared to the variability in the unimodal conditions. This reduction in variability is consistent with optimal integration of the auditory and visual speed signals. The average bias in the estimated arrival times depends on the motion speed: for medium speeds (17 deg/s) observers' subjective arrival times are earlier than the true arrival times; for high speeds (47 deg/s) observers exhibit a (much smaller) bias in the other direction. This speed-dependency suggests that the bias is due to an error in estimating the motion speeds rather than an error in calibrating the timing of the motor response. Finally, in this temporal localization task, the bias and variability show similar patterns for motion defined by vision, audition or both. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We investigate the relation between the physical world and its mental representation in the 'cognitive map', and test if this representation is image-like and complies with the laws of Euclidean geometry. We have developed a new experimental technique using 'impossible' virtual environments (VE) to directly influence the representational development. Subjects explore a number of VEs - some 'normal', others with severe violations of Euclidean metrics or planar topology. We check if these manipulated properties cause problems in navigation performance. A consistent VE should be easily represented mentally in a map-like fashion, while a VE with severe violations should prove difficult. Surprisingly, we found no substantial influence of the impossible VEs on navigation performance, and forced-choice tests showed little evidence that subjects were aware of manipulations. This suggests that the representation does not resemble a two-dimensional image-like map. Alternatives to consider are sensorimotor and graph-like representations. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Based on the neurobiological and cognitive principles of human information processing, we develop a system for the automatic visual identification and exploration of scenes. The system architecture consists of three layers: a bottom-up feature extraction stage, a top-down object identification stage and knowledge from a domain ontology for scene analysis. The uncertainty in the latter two stages is managed by Dempster-Shafer belief measures. The system sequentially selects "informative" image regions, identifies the local structure in these regions, and uses this information for drawing efficient conclusions about an object in the scene. The selection process involves low-level, bottom-up processes for sensory feature extraction, and cognitive top-down processes for the generation of active motor commands that control the positioning of the sensors towards the most informative regions. Both processing levels have to deal with uncertain data, and have to take into account learned statistical knowledge. For bottom-up feature extraction this is achieved by integrating a nonlinear filtering stage modeled after the neural computations performed in the early stages of the visual system. The top-down cognitive reasoning strategy operates in an adaptive fashion on a belief distribution. The resulting object hypotheses in combination with knowledge from the domain ontology in the third layer are used for generating a scene hypothesis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We investigate a hybrid system for autonomous exploration and navigation, and implement it in a virtual mobile agent, which operates in virtual spatial environments. The system is based on several distinguishing properties. The representation is not map-like, but based on sensorimotor features, i.e. on combinations of sensory features and motor actions. The system has a hybrid architecture, which integrates a bottom-up processing of sensorimotor features with a top-down, knowledge-based reasoning strategy. This strategy selects the optimal motor action in each step according to the principle of maximum information gain. Two sensorimotor levels with different behavioural granularity are implemented, a macro-level, which controls the movements of the agent in space, and a micro-level, which controls its eye movements. At each level, the same type of hybrid architecture and the same principle of information gain are used for sensorimotor control. The localisation performance of the system is tested with large sets of virtual rooms containing different mixtures of unique and non-unique objects. The results demonstrate that the system efficiently performs those exploratory motor actions that yield a maximum amount of information about the current environment. Localisation is typically achieved within a few steps. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the underlying computations is limited, and the system is robust with respect to minor variations in the spatial environments. © 2008 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Urinary incontinence is a typical symptom found on a variety of diseases common to the elderly population that has a strong negative influence in the autonomy of the individuals suffering from it. Besides its physical consequences such as infections and skin damages, it also has a strong impact on the social life of the patient and his/her family. In this paper, we propose a methodology and architecture currently under development that could increase the independence of the patient suffering from urinary incontinence and could ease the tasks of caretakers/caregivers, thus improving the lifestyle of patients and their families.

abstract={Ontologies provide a representation of precise knowledge about concepts, their attributes and relations. The Dempster-Shafer theory provides a representation of epistemicplausibilities. In AI both representations are typically developed separately on purpose, which isappropriate unless theircombinationis required. Real world applications, however, sometimes require a combination of both. In this paper we will present such a combination of a domain ontology and uncertain knowledge. Our approach arises from the need of a room classification system for representing room concepts (in the sense of classifying names that are cognitively assigned to rooms, such as "kitchen", "laboratory", "office") that can be derived from objects occurring in the rooms. These room concepts can only be determined with a certain degree of belief, not so much depending on the system's quality as depending on ambiguities in the cognitive assignment of room concepts. Hence, uncertainty about concepts that exist in reality also needs to be represented in the application. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={We investigate the hypothesis that the basic representation of space which underlies human navigation does not resemble an image-like map and is not restricted by the laws of Euclidean geometry. For this we developed a new experimental technique in which we use the properties of a virtual environment (VE) to directly influence the development of the representation. We compared the navigation performance of human observers under two conditions. Either the VE is consistent with the geometrical properties of physical space and could hence be represented in a map-like fashion, or it contains severe violations of Euclidean metric and planar topology, and would thus pose difficulties for the correct development of such a representation. Performance is not influenced by this difference, suggesting that a map-like representation is not the major basis of human navigation. Rather, the results are consistent with a representation which is similar to a non-planar graph augmented with path length information, or with a sensorimotor representation which combines sensory properties and motor actions. The latter may be seen as part of a revised view of perceptual processes due to recent results in psychology and neurobiology, which indicate that the traditional strict separation of sensory and motor systems is no longer tenable. © 2007 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={We investigate the hypothesis that the main representation which underlies human navigation is not static and map-like, but rather is of an inherently sensorimotor nature, i.e. results from a combination of sensory features and motor actions. This is suggested by recent psychological and neurobiological results, and receives further support from an own study of human navigation in manipulated virtual reality environments. To investigate the presumed sensorimotor representation we design a hybrid architecture which integrates a bottom-up processing of sensorimotor features with a top-down reasoning that is based on the principle of maximum information gain. This architecture is implemented in an agent that operates in a VR environment and is able to use a minimum number of exploratory actions to orient itself within this environment. © Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Humans are very efficient in the analysis, exploration and representation of their environment. Based on the neurobiological and cognitive principles of human information processing, we develop a system for the automatic identification and exploration of spatial configurations. The system sequentially selects "informative" regions (regions of interest), identifies the local structure, and uses this information for drawing efficient conclusions about the current scene. The selection process involves low-level, bottom-up processes for sensory feature extraction, and cognitive top-down processes for the generation of active motor commands that control the positioning of the sensors towards the most informative regions. Both processing levels have to deal with uncertain data, and have to take into account previous knowledge from statistical properties and learning. We suggest that this can be achieved in a hybrid architecture which integrates a nonlinear filtering stage modelled after the neural computations performed in the early stages of the visual system, and a cognitive reasoning strategy that operates in an adaptive fashion on a belief distribution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={The perception of an image by a human observer is a highly selective procedure in that only a small subset of image locations is selected and processed by the precise and efficient neural machinery of foveal vision. To understand the principles behind this selection of the informative regions of images, a hybrid system is developed that consists of a combination of a top-down knowledge-based reasoning system with a low-level preprocessing by linear and nonlinear neural operators. In the analysis of a scene, the system generates a fixation sequence by calculating in each step that feature has to be selected next to reach a maximum of information gain. The information gain calculation is based on the Dempster-Shafer belief theory that is also used to establish a hypothesis about the scene. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We investigated the extent to which auditory and visual motion signals are combined when observers are asked to predict the location of a virtually moving target. In Condition 1, the unimodal and bimodal signals were noisy, but the target object was continuously visible and audible; in Condition 2, the virtually moving object was hidden (invisible and inaudible) for a short period prior to its arrival at the target location. Our main finding was that the facilitation due to simultaneous visual and auditory input is very different for the two conditions. When the target is continuously visible and audible (Condition 1), the bimodal performance is twice as good as the unimodal performances, thus suggesting a very effective integration mechanism. On the other hand, if the object is hidden for a short period (Condition 2) and the task therefore requires the extrapolation of motion speed over a temporal and spatial period, the facilitation due to both sensory inputs is almost absent, and the bimodal performance is limited by the visual performance.},

abstract={We have previously shown that the integration of non-local auditory and visual motion can best be explained by a probability summation model that uses direction-independent signals from modality specific motion detectors [Wuerger et al. (2002), Journal of Vision, 2(7), 663a]. This finding contradicts other perceptual and physiological data which suggests that auditory and visual signals are integrated at an early stage. We hypothesize that this low-level integration crucially depends on the auditory and visual signals to be co-incident and co-localized. To test this hypothesis we measured motion detection thresholds for auditory, visual and bi-modal motion stimuli, which were presented along a horizontal arc, containing 31 LEDs and loudspeakers, spaced 5 degrees apart. Each motion signal described an arc of 90 degrees in either the left or right hemi-field in front of the observer. The auditory and visual components used for the bimodal stimuli moved independently, hence they could be in the same or different hemi-fields and move in the same or opposite direction. Thresholds were significantly reduced only when the auditory and visual motion signals move in the same direction and are located in the same hemi-field. A neural summation model explains the data for this congruent condition. In all other conditions the bi-modal thresholds could be explained by an independent-decision model. We conclude that auditory and visual signals have to be co-localized to be integrated effectively. This is consistent with the idea that local auditory and visual signals are integrated before motion is extracted.},

abstract={Any mobile agent able to interact with moving objects or other mobile agents requires the ability to process motion shapes. The human visual system is an excellent, fast and proven machinery for dealing with such information. In order to obtain insight into the properties of this biological machine and to transfer it to artificial agents we analyze the limitations and capabilities of human perception of motion shapes. Here we present new empirical results on the classification, extrapolation and prediction of motion shape with varying degrees of complexity. In addition, results on the processing of multisensory spatio-temporal information will be presented. We make use of our earlier argument for the existence of a spatio-temporal memory in early vision and use the basic properties of this structure in the first layer of a neural network model. We discuss major architectural features of this network, which is based on Kohonens self-organizing maps. This network can be used as an interface to further representational stage on which motion vectors are implemented in a qualitative way. Both components of this hybrid model are constrained by the results gained in the psychophysical experiments.},

abstract={The perception of spatio-temporal pattern is a fundamental part of visual cognition. In order to understand more about the principles behind these biological processes, we are analysing and modeling the representation of spatio-temporal structures on different levels of abstraction. For the low-level processing of motion information we have argued for the existence of a spatio-temporal memory in early vision. The basic properties of this structure are reflected in a neural network model which is currently developed. Here we discuss major architectural features of this network which is based on Kohonens SOMs (self organizing maps). In order to enable the representation, processing and prediction of spatio-temporal pattern on different levels of granularity and abstraction the SOM’s are organized in a hierarchical manner. The model has the advantage of a “self-teaching” learning algorithm and stores temporal information by local feedback in each computational layer. The constraints for the neural modeling and the data sets for training the neural network are obtained by psychophysical experiments where human subjects’ abilities for dealing with spatio-temporal information is investigated. © 2001 SPIE.},

abstract={The perception of an image by a human observer is usually modeled as a parallel process in which all parts of the image are treated more or less equivalently, but in reality the analysis of scenes is a highly selective procedure, in which only a small subset of image locations is processed by the precise and efficient neural machinery of foveal vision. To understand the principles behind this selection of the "informative" regions of images, we have developed a hybrid system that consists of a combination of a knowledge-based reasoning system with a low-level preprocessing by linear and nonlinear neural operators. This hybrid system is intended as a first step towards a complete model of the sensorimotor system of saccadic scene analysis. In the analysis of a scene, the system calculates in each step which eye movement has to be made to reach a maximum of information about the scene. The possible information gain is calculated by means of a parallel strategy which is suitable for adaptive reasoning. The output of the system is a fixation sequence, and finally, a hypothesis about the scene. © 2001 SPIE and IS&T.},

abstract={Based on an information theoretical approach, we investigate feature selection processes in saccadic object and scene analysis. Saccadic eye movements of human observers are recorded for a variety of natural and artificial test images. These experimental data are used for a statistical evaluation of the fixated image regions. Analysis of second-order statistics indicates that regions with higher spatial variance have a higher probability to be fixated, but no significant differences beyond these variance effects could be found at the level of power spectra. By contrast, an investigation with higher-order statistics, as reflected in the bispectral density, yielded clear structural differences between the image regions selected by saccadic eye movements as opposed to regions selected by a random process. These results indicate that nonredundant, intrinsically two-dimensional image features like curved lines and edges, occlusions, isolated spots, etc. play an important role in the saccadic selection process which must be integrated with top-down knowledge to fully predict object and scene analysis by human observers.},

Whereas research in this field is typically concerned with the formulation and implementation of visual algorithms like, e.g., navigation by an analysis of the retinal flow pattern caused by locomotion, we are interested in memory based capabilities, like the recognition of complicated gestures [16]. The result of this array of experiments will deliver a subset of parameters used for the training of an artificial neural network model.Al ternatively, these parameters are important for determining the ranges of symbolic descriptions like, e.g., the qualitative approach by [11] in order to provide an user interface matched to conditions in human vision.Th e architecture of the neural net will be briefly sketched.Its output will be used as input for a higher-level stage modelled with qualitative means. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

abstract={The processing and representation of motion information is addressed from an integrated perspective comprising lowlevel signal processing properties as well as higher-level cognitive aspects. For the low-level processing of motion information we argue that a fundamental requirement is the existence of a spatiotemporal memory. Its key feature, the provision of an orthogonal relation between external time and its internal representation, is achieved by a mapping of temporal structure into a locally distributed activity distribution accessible in parallel by higher-level processing stages. This leads to a reinterpretation of the classical concept of "iconic memory" and resolves inconsistencies on ultra-short-Time processing and visual masking. The spatio-Temporal memory is further investigated by experiments on the perception of spatio-Temporal patterns. Resuits on the direction discrimination of motion paths provide evidence that information about direction and location are not processed and represented independant of each other. This suggests a unified representation on an early level, in the sense that motion information is internally available in form of a spatio-Temporal compound. For the higher-level representation we have developed a formal framework for the qualitative description of courses of motion that may occur with moving objects. © 1998 SPIE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Decision support systems use two basic strategies: the pursuit of a small set of hypotheses and the sequential partitioning of hierarchical hypothesis structures. We present an alternative method based on the maximization of information gain. In each step, we evaluate the difference between the actual and potential future evidence distributions. The data 'promising' the maximum information gain are then inquired by the system. In simple situations, the new method behaves like traditional strategies but in divergent and inconsistent evidence situations, it avoids the drawbacks induced by the predetermined standard strategies by adapting itself continuously to the actual data configuration. Our method can be extended to layered hierarchical data structures, where its behavior is reminiscent of the cognitive phenomenon of 'restructuring'.},

abstract={Deciding which of the existing uncertainty theories is the appropriate one to use in the formalization of a given problem is still a difficult task. It is possible to compare these theories either using pragmatic considerations (eg. efficiency) or experimentally applying them on a set of problems; however, up to now there is no general frame in which we can compare the uncertainty theories with respect to their meanings. Our work aims to develop a general formalism for representing and reasoning with uncertain knowledge, which provides such a framework and is not restricted in using one specific uncertainty theory as a basis. This formalism is based on the work of Carnap's Logical Foundation of Probability. But, instead of propositions, we regard distinctions as elementary notions. Up until now, the following theories can be expressed within the framework: Bayes theory, Fuzzy set theory, Dempster/Shafer theory (Belief functions) and Upper/Lower probability theory.},

abstract={With a minimal set of assumptions resulting from considerations about the perception of temporal structure, we argue for the existence of a spatio-temporal memory established by the mapping of time into simultaneous physical properties. The important point of this model is the distinction between external, physical time and the internal representation of time. An immediate consequence of such a structure is the emergence of properties usually associated with the concept of iconic memory or informational persistence. Some of these properties may hence be regarded as epiphenomena produced by the testing of a spatio-temporal system with tachistoscopic spatial stimuli. The model can explain properties of the immediate memory span, the lack of effect of exposure duration on tachistoscopic report, the partial-report superiority, the decay of iconic memory, and effects of a backward mask. It does not only avoid the incompatibility problems of the frozen-image concept in dynamic vision, but also provides an adequate basis for the processing of time-varying scenes. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We have obtained evidence from an intrahemispheric learning task using a choice-reaction-time paradigm that the acquisition of a sensorimotor skill can be discontinuous. Subjects had to react as fast as possible to either a visual or an auditory stimulus. In several successive sessions, reaction times improved markedly, however in a discontinuous way. Different levels of performance were characterized by discrete functional states, each state being associated with a particular temporal window. After sufficient learning, reactions were confined to the earlier of two such windows. © Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd.},
