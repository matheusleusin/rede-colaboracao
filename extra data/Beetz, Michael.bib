abstract={Manipulation planning and control are relevant building blocks of a robotic system and their tight integration is a key factor to improve robot autonomy and allows robots to perform manipulation tasks of increasing complexity, such as those needed in the in-store logistics domain. Supermarkets contain a large variety of objects to be placed on the shelf layers with specific constraints, doing this with a robot is a challenge and requires a high dexterity. However, an integration of reactive grasping control and motion planning can allow robots to perform such tasks even with grippers with limited dexterity. The main contribution of the letter is a novel method for planning manipulation tasks to be executed using a reactive control layer that provides more control modalities, i.e., slipping avoidance and controlled sliding. Experiments with a new force/tactile sensor equipping the gripper of a mobile manipulator show that the approach allows the robot to successfully perform manipulation tasks unfeasible with a standard fixed grasp. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={When performing task in open-ended environment, a robot may not have access to conventional tools required in the task. In such case, an ideal response for the robot would be to find a suitable substitute. In this paper, we present an approach to tool substitution where robot-centric knowledge is generated in an unsupervised manner about objects from multi-modal sensory data captured by a robot. This robot-centric knowledge is subsequently exploited to identify a substitute from available objects observed in the environment. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={To enable cooperative task planning and coordination between the human operator and robot teams, new types of interfaces are needed. We present an interactive strategic mission management system (ISMMS) for underwater explorations performed by mixed teams of robots and human investigators that enables cooperative task planning and coordination between the human operator and robot teams. Main goals of the ISMMS are to enable robots to “explain” their intentions, problems, and situation fast and in an intuitive fashion to humans, to allow smooth blending between autonomous behavior and human control, to provide smart interfaces to mandatory external control and to enable adaptive task sharing while being optimized with respect to intuitive usage and interaction measured by behavioral and physiological human data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Robotic systems in production environments have to adapt quickly to new situations and products to enable customization and short product cycles. This is especially true for the robot perception, which is sensitive to changes in environment and task. Therefore, we present an approach to quickly synthesize perception pipelines based on hierarchical planning. We calibrate the hierarchical model, such that it reflects condensed experience from historical data. We validate our approach in a simulated assembly scenario with objects from the Siemens Robot Learning Challenge, taking into account different possible sensor types and placements. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Autonomous indoor robots are supposed to accomplish tasks, like serve a cup, which involve manipulation actions, where task and motion planning levels are coupled. In both planning levels and execution phase, several source of failures can occur. In this paper, an interpretation ontology covering several sources of failures in automated planning and also during the execution phases is introduced with the purpose of working the planning more informed and the execution prepared for recovery. The proposed failure interpretation ontological module covers: (1) geometric failures, that may appear when e.g. the robot can not reach to grasp/place an object, there is no free-collision path or there is no feasible Inverse Kinematic (IK) solution. (2) hardware related failures that may appear when e.g. the robot in a real environment requires to be re-calibrated (gripper or arm), or it is sent to a non-reachable configuration. (3) software agent related failures, that may appear when e.g. the robot has software components that fail like when an algorithm is not able to extract the proper features. The paper describes the concepts and the implementation of failure interpretation ontology in several foundations like DUL and SUMO, and presents an example showing different situations in planning demonstrating the range of information the framework can provide for autonomous robots. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The configuration of perception pipelines is a complex procedure that requires substantial amounts of engineering effort and knowledge. A pipeline consists of interconnected individual perception operators and their parameters, which leads to a large configuration space of pipeline structures and parameterizations. This configuration space has to be explored efficiently in order to find a solution that fulfills the specific requirements of the target application. In this paper, we present an approach to perform automatic configuration based on structure templates and sequential model-based optimization. The structure templates allow to reduce the search space and encode prior engineering knowledge. We introduce a structure template based on hypothesis generation, hypothesis refinement, and hypothesis testing to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Experimental evaluation with state-of-the-art operators is performed on data from the T-LESS dataset as well as in a real-world robotic assembly task. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Plan execution on real robots in realistic environments is underdetermined and often leads to failures. The choice of action parameterization is crucial for task success. In this paper, we present a mechanism for a robot that is acting in a real-world environment to think ahead of time with fast plan projection and, thereby, choose action parameterizations that are predicted to lead to successful execution. For finding causal relationships between action parameterizations and task success, we provide the robot with means for plan introspection and propose a systematic and hierarchical plan structure to support that. We evaluate our approach by showing how a PR2 robot, when equipped with the proposed system, is able to choose action parameterizations that increase task execution success rates and overall performance of fetch and place actions in a real world setting. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={As robots start to execute complex manipulation tasks, they are expected to improve their skill set over time as humans do. A prominent approach to accomplish this is having robots to keep models of their actions based on their experiences in order to improve their action executions in the future. In this paper, we present such a methodology where robots start to execute some actions with random parameters and record their generic execution logs with semantic annotations in a symbolic knowledge base for robots. Using the data inside logs, multivariate Gaussian mixture models are fitted to the high-level action parameters for later executions. These affordance models are being updated whenever a new execution is carried on. In essence, robots can use these continuously-updated probabilistic model for improving their actions To prove the applicability we demonstrate opening-a-fridge-door experiments with a PR2 robot. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Human beings can generalize from one action to similar ones. Robots cannot do this and progress concerning information transfer between robotic actions is slow. We have designed a system that performs action generalization for manipulation actions in different scenarios. It relies on an action representation for which we perform code-snippet replacement, combining information from different actions to form new ones. The system interprets human instructions via a parser using simplified language. It uses action and object names to index action data tables (ADTs), where execution-relevant information is stored. We have created an ADT database from three different sources (KUKA LWR, UR5, and simulation) and show how a new ADT is generated by cutting and recombining data from existing ADTs. To achieve this, a small set of action templates is used. After parsing a new instruction, index-based searching finds similar ADTs in the database. Then the action template of the new action is matched against the information in the similar ADTs. Code snippets are extracted and ranked according to matching quality. The new ADT is created by concatenating code snippets from best matches. For execution, only coordinate transforms are needed to account for the poses of the objects in the new scene. The system was evaluated, without additional error correction, using 45 unknown objects in 81 new action executions, with 80% success. We then extended the method including more detailed shape information, which further reduced errors. This demonstrates that cut & recombine is a viable approach for action generalization in service robotic applications. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Robot task programming often leads to inefficient plans, as opportunities for parallelization and precomputation are usually not exploited by the programmer. This inefficiency is often especially obvious in mobile manipulation, where path planning and pose estimation algorithms are time-consuming operations. In this letter, we introduce the concept of resource-aware task nodes (RATNs), a powerful descriptive action model for robots. Next, we propose an algorithm that executes so-called concurrent dataflow task networks (CDTNs), robot plans consisting of RATNs. It optimizes programmed plans based on two sources of information: 1) The control flow represented in the original task plan, whose constraints are relaxed to generate opportunities for parallelization and precomputation. 2) Dependencies between actions pertaining to resources, data flows, and world model changes, the latter being equivalent to preconditions and effects. CDTNs have been integrated in our open-source task programming framework RAFCON, and we show that it leads to 11%-29% improvement in terms of execution time in two simulated mobile manipulation scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, advances in robotics’ technology and research focus on complex scenarios. In these scenarios, robots have to act and respond fast to situational demands. First, they require heterogeneous knowledge from various sources. Then, they need to integrate this knowledge with their reasoning methodologies. These reasoning methodologies are typically different for every domain. This paper introduces an integrated knowledge processing methodology. This methodology uses query mechanisms and model-to-model transformations. Combining these two mechanisms enables processing of heterogeneous knowledge bases. The methodology is demonstrated for an outdoor scenario with diverse systems. In this scenario knowledge and reasoning methods from various sources are integrated. This includes static knowledge from. Open Sreet Map and Digital Elevation Models. The Robot Scene Graph tracks changes in the world and provides geometric reasoning. KnowRob with its SHERPA ontology and OPENEASE provide further reasoning capabilities. © 2019},

abstract={Industrial and technological innovations constantly call for the development of materials that meet specific and novel requirement profiles. However, the engineering of materials with the desired properties is a time-, cost-, and labor-intensive process as changing the composition and the parameterization of processing steps yields an unimaginably large search space. It is therefore crucial for the future engineering of materials to be conducted in a more goal-directed and more efficient way to generate informative hypotheses revealing particularly promising experiments and thus guiding the exploration process in a more informed fashion. In this paper, we present MATCALO, an intelligent, cognitive assistant system that supports materials scientists in developing novel materials. MATCALO combines modern machine learning techniques with machine-interpretable semantic knowledge in order to model representations of relationships between materials, processes and properties and allow reasoning about them. We showcase a prototypical approach for generating such hypotheses by reverse-querying regression models learned from experimental data. However, a workable set of experiments alone generally does not suffice as it will never cover an adequately large area of the search space, which led us to the conclusion that additional background knowledge is required to build more reliable models. The readers can assure themselves of the feasibility of this approach by testing the web-based interface using the MATCALO system which will be made available to the broad community. Given a requirement profile, the system generates hypotheses on how these criteria can be achieved. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In the factories and distribution centers of the future, humans and robots shall work together in close proximity and even physically interact. This shift to joint human–robot teams raises the question of how to ensure worker safety. In this manuscript, we present a novel episodic memory system for safety-aware robots. Using this system, the robots can answer questions about their actions at the level of safety concepts. We built this system as an extension of the KnowRob framework and its notion of episodic memories. We evaluated the system in a safe physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) experiment, in which a robot had to sort surgical instruments while also ensuring the safety of its human co-workers. Our experimental results show the efficacy of the system to act as a robot’s belief state for online reasoning, as well as its ability to support offline safety analysis through its fast and flexible query interface. To this end, we demonstrate the system’s ability to reconstruct its geometric environment, course of action, and motion parameters from descriptions of safety-relevant events. We also show-case the system’s capability to conduct statistical analysis. © 2019, Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The development of high-performance perception for mobile robotic agents is still challenging. Learning appropriate perception models usually requires extensive amounts of labeled training data that ideally follows the same distribution as the data an agent will encounter in its target task. Recent developments in gaming industry led to game engines able to generate photorealistic environments in real-time, which can be used to realistically simulate the sensory input of an agent.We propose a novel framework which allows the definition of different learning scenarios and instantiates these scenarios in a high quality game engine where a perceptual agent can act and learn in. The scenarios are specified in a newly developed scenario description language that allows the parametrization of the virtual environment and the perceptual agent. New scenarios can be sampled from a task-specific object distribution that allows the automatic generation of extensive amounts of different learning environments for the perceptual agent.We will demonstrate the plausibility of the framework by conducting object recognition experiments on a real robotic system which has been trained within our framework. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We address the problem of executing tool-using manipulation skills in scenarios where the objects to be used may vary. We assume that point clouds of the tool and target object can be obtained, but no interpretation or further knowledge about these objects is provided. The system must interpret the point clouds and decide how to use the tool to complete a manipulation task with a target object; this means it must adjust motion trajectories appropriately to complete the task. We tackle three everyday manipulations: scraping material from a tool into a container, cutting, and scooping from a container. Our solution encodes these manipulation skills in a generic way, with parameters that can be filled in at run-time via queries to a robot perception module; the perception module abstracts the functional parts of the tool and extracts key parameters that are needed for the task. The approach is evaluated in simulation and with selected examples on a PR2 robot. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Advanced cognitive capabilities enable humans to solve even complex tasks by representing and processing internal models of manipulation actions and their effects. Consequently, humans are able to plan the effect of their motions before execution and validate the performance afterwards. In this work, we derive an analog approach for robotic wiping actions which are fundamental for some of the most frequent household chores including vacuuming the floor, sweeping dust, and cleaning windows. We describe wiping actions and their effects based on a qualitative particle distribution model. This representation enables a robot to plan goal-oriented wiping motions for the prototypical wiping actions of absorbing, collecting and skimming. The particle representation is utilized to simulate the task outcome before execution and infer the real performance afterwards based on haptic perception. This way, the robot is able to estimate the task performance and schedule additional motions if necessary. We evaluate our methods in simulated scenarios, as well as in real experiments with the humanoid service robot Rollin’ Justin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Joint simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) constitutes the basis for cooperative action in multi-robot teams. We designed a stereo vision-based 6D SLAM system combining local and global methods to benefit from their particular advantages: (1) Decoupled local reference filters on each robot for real-time, long-term stable state estimation required for stabilization, control and fast obstacle avoidance; (2) Online graph optimization with a novel graph topology and intra- as well as inter-robot loop closures through an improved submap matching method to provide global multi-robot pose and map estimates; (3) Distribution of the processing of high-frequency and high-bandwidth measurements enabling the exchange of aggregated and thus compacted map data. As a result, we gain robustness with respect to communication losses between robots. We evaluated our improved map matcher on simulated and real-world datasets and present our full system in five real-world multi-robot experiments in areas of up 3,000 m 2 (bounding box), including visual robot detections and submap matches as loop-closure constraints. Further, we demonstrate its application to autonomous multi-robot exploration in a challenging rough-terrain environment at a Moon-analogue site located on a volcano. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Robots designed to interact with humans in realistic environments must be able to handle uncertainty with respect to the identities and properties of the people, places, and things found in their environments. When humans refer to these entities using under-specified language, robots must often generate clarification requests to determine which entities were meant. In this paper, we first present recommendations for designers of robots needing to generate such requests. We then show how a Dempster-Shafer theoretic pragmatic reasoning component capable of generating requests to clarify pragmatic uncertainty can also generate requests to resolve referential uncertainty when integrated with probabilistic reference resolution and referring expression generation components. Our system is then demonstrated in a simulated alpine search and rescue context enabled by a novel hybrid architecture. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Embodied intelligent agents that are equipped with sensors and actuators have unique characteristics and requirements regarding the storage, management, and usage of information. The goal is to perform intentional activities, within the perception-action loop of the agent, based on the information acquired from its senses, background knowledge, naive physics knowledge, etc. The challenge is to integrate many different types of information required for competent andintelligent decision-making into a coherent information system. In this chapter, we will describe a conceptual framework in which such information system can be represented and talked about. We will provide an overview about the different types of information an intelligent robot needs to adaptively and dexterously perform everyday activities. In our framework, every time a robot performs an activity, it creates an episodic memory. It can also acquire experiences from mental simulations, learn from these real and simulated experiences, and share them with other robots through dedicated knowledge web services. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Within the next decades, robots will need to be able to execute a large variety of tasks autonomously in a large variety of environments. To relax the resulting programming effort, a knowledge-enabled approach to robot programming can be adopted to organize information in re-usable knowledge pieces. However, for the ease of reuse, there needs to be an agreement on the meaning of terms. A common approach is to represent these terms using ontology languages that conceptualize the respective domain. In this work, we will review projects that use ontologies to support robot autonomy. We will systematically search for projects that fulfill a set of inclusion criteria and compare them with each other with respect to the scope of their ontology, what types of cognitive capabilities are supported by the use of ontologies, and which is their application domain. © Cambridge University Press 2019.},

abstract={Adapting the perceptual capabilities of mobile robots to new objects or new environments can be a time consuming task. In this paper we focus on specializing perceptual capabilities of mobile robots to new objects through a knowledge based, virtual scene rendering approach. Episodic memories of a robotic agent, gathered during the execution of a task are considered to be the main theme. Variations of this theme are then generated based on background knowledge about the objects and data gathered with the purpose of learning new models for detection and recognition. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by adapting the perceptual capabilities of a mobile robot performing pick and place tasks, to recognize new sets of objects. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={AI knowledge representation and reasoning methods consider actions to be blackboxes that abstract away from how they are executed. This abstract view does not suffice for the decision making capabilities required by robotic agents that are to accomplish manipulation tasks. Such robots have to reason about how to pour without spilling, where to grasp a pot, how to open different containers, and so on. To enable such reasoning it is necessary to consider how objects are perceived, how motions can be executed and parameterized, and how motion parameterization affects the physical effects of actions. To this end, we propose to complement and extend symbolic reasoning methods with KnowRobSIM, an additional reasoning infrastructure based on modern game engine technology, including the subsymbolic world modeling through data structures, action simulation based on physics engine, and world scene rendering. We demonstrate how KnowRobSIM can perform powerful reasoning, prediction, and learning tasks that are required for informed decision making in object manipulation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Semantic navigation is the navigation paradigm in which environmental semantic concepts and their relationships are taken into account to plan the route of a mobile robot. This paradigm facilitates the interaction with humans and the understanding of human environments in terms of navigation goals and tasks. At the high level, a semantic navigation system requires two main components: a semantic representation of the environment, and a reasoning system. This paper is focused on develop a model of the environment using semantic concepts. This paper presents two solutions for the semantic navigation paradigm. Both systems implement an ontological model. Whilst the first one uses a relational database, the second one is based on KnowRob. Both systems have been integrated in a semantic navigator. We compare both systems at the qualitative and quantitative levels, and present an implementation on a mobile robot as a proof of concept. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advancements in robotic technology and the progress in human-robot interaction research, the interest in deploying mixed human-robot teams in rescue missions is increasing. Due to their complementary capabilities in terms of locomotion, visibility and reachability of areas, human-robot teams are considerably deployed in real-world settings, albeit the robotic agents in such scenarios are normally fully teleoperated. A major barrier to successful and efficient mission execution in those teams is the lack of cognitive skills in robotic systems. In this paper, we present a cognition-enabled framework and an implemented system where robotic agents are equipped with cognitive capabilities to naturally communicate with humans and autonomously perform tasks. The framework allows for natural tasking of robots, reasoning about robot behavior, capabilities and actions, and a common belief state representation for shared mission awareness of robots and human operators. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present KnowRob2, a second generation knowledge representation and reasoning framework for robotic agents. KnowRob2 is an extension and partial redesign of KnowRob, currently one of the most advanced knowledge processing systems for robots that has enabled them to successfully perform complex manipulation tasks such as making pizza, conducting chemical experiments, and setting tables. The knowledge base appears to be a conventional first-order time interval logic knowledge base, but it exists to a large part only virtually: many logical expressions are constructed on demand from data structures of the control program, computed through robotics algorithms including ones for motion planning and solving inverse kinematics problems, and log data stored in noSQL databases. Novel features and extensions of KnowRob2 substantially increase the capabilities of robotic agents of acquiring open-ended manipulation skills and competence, reasoning about how to perform manipulation actions more realistically, and acquiring commonsense knowledge. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensor guided, automated systems require the composition of various sensors and data processing algorithms to obtain relevant information for performing their task. Many applications have additional requirements such as a certain accuracy, which has to be achieved despite sensor noise and calibration errors. In this paper we model the configuration of perception systems as a planning problem over probabilistic graphical models. We work on a subset of the full configuration space of perceptions systems, specifically the used sensors, data processing algorithms and view poses. Based on a semantic description of the goal, available sensors and data processing algorithms, our system plans perception steps and sensor data fusion autonomously. The planner operates by constructing a factor graph until the accuracy requirements of tasks are fulfilled or unobtainable with the available action set. We validate our approach in an industrial assembly scenario. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To enable robots to perform human-level tasks flexibly in varying conditions, we need a mechanism that allows them to exchange knowledge between themselves for crowd-sourcing the knowledge gap problem. One approach to achieve this is to equip a cloud application with a range of encyclopedic knowledge (i.e. ontologies) and execution logs of different robots performing the same tasks in different environments. In this paper, we show how knowledge exchange between robots can be done using OPENEASE as the cloud application. We equipped OPENEASE with ontologies about the kitchen domain, execution logs of three robots operating in two different kitchens, and semantic descriptions of both environments. By addressing two different use cases, we show that two PR2 robots and one Fetch robot can successfully adapt each other's plan parameters and sub symbolic data to the experiments that they are conducting. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of space missions and terrestrial applications, both mission goals and task implementations for autonomous robots are becoming increasingly complex. Thus, the challenge of monitoring the achievement of task objectives and checking the correctness of their implementation is becoming more and more difficult. To tackle these problems, we propose an unified architecture that supports different stakeholders during the different phases of the deployment: 1) the design phase; 2) the runtime phase; and 3) the postmortem analysis phase. Furthermore, we implement this architecture by enhancing our task programming framework RMC advanced flow control with powerful logging, debugging, and profiling capabilities. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in the context of the ROBEX mission, during which the DLR Lightweight Rover Unit autonomously deployed several seismometers in an unknown rough terrain on Mt. Etna, Sicily. The analysis results for a state machine consisting of more than 1500 states and more than 1900 transitions are presented. Finally, we give a comparison between our framework and related software tools. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Mixed human-robot teams are increasingly considered for accomplishing complex mission due to their complementary capabilities. A major barrier for deploying such heterogeneous teams in real-world settings, is the current lack of natural skills in robotic team members, such as the understanding and interpretation of natural language instructions that include referential descriptions of entities in the world. In this paper we report the results of an empirical study in which humans tend to use referring expressions. We show how the received results and ideas can be used as guidelines to improve dialogue systems. By integrating and extending our system with these results, we will show how complex natural language instructions can be easily translated by robotic systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&R) systems are widely employed for the representation of abstract knowledge. Action models are usually representations of state transitions: Actions can be performed if all pre-conditions are met, and it is expected that the designated effects will take place when the action is executed. However, embodied agents need additional knowledge about how their body should be moved to achieve their goals without causing unwanted side effects. The proposed action representation is based on force dynamic events that occur when an embodied agent interacts with its world. We show how patterns of force events can be used to define semantics of action verbs. Robots use our model to acquire episodic memories which are stories of their performance coupled with sub-symbolic data, and they share their experience through the knowledge service openEASE.

abstract={The vision of service robots that autonomously manipulate objects as skillfully and flexibly as humans is still an open challenge. Findings from cognitive psychology suggest that the human brain structures manipulation actions along representations of contact events and their perceptually distinctive sensory signals. In this letter, we investigate how to reliably detect and classify contact events during robotic wiping actions. We present an algorithm that learns the distinct shapes of force measurements during contact events using multidimensional time-series shapelets. We evaluate our approach on a dataset consisting of 460 real-world robot wiping episodes that we collected using a table-mounted robot with a wrist-mounted force/torque sensor. Our approach shows good performance with tenfold cross validation yielding 97.5% precision and 99.3% recall, and can also be used for online contact event detection and classification. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Assembly cells run by intelligent robotic agents promise highly flexible product customization without the cost implication product individualization has nowadays. One of the main questions an assembly robot has to answer is which sequence of manipulation actions it should perform to create an assembled product from scattered pieces available. We propose a novel approach to assembly planning that employs Description Logics (DL) to describe what an assembled product should look like, and to plan the next action according to faulty and missing assertions in the robot's beliefs about an ongoing assembly task. To this end we extend the KnowRob knowledge base with representations and inference rules that enable robots to reason about incomplete assemblies. We show that our approach performs well for large batches of assembly pieces available, as well as for varying structural complexity of assembled products. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

abstract={Robots are becoming ever more present in households, interacting more with humans. They are able to perform tasks in an accurate manner, e.g. manipulating objects. However, this manipulation often does not follow the human way to arrange objects. Therefore, robots require semantic knowledge about the environment for executing tasks and satisfying humans’ expectations. In this paper, we will introduce a breakfast table setting scenario where a robot acquires information from human demonstrations to arrange objects in a meaningful way. We will show how robots can obtain the necessary amount of knowledge to autonomously perform daily tasks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={Assembly recipes can elegantly be represented in description logic theories. With such a recipe, the robot can figure out the next assembly step through logical inference. However, before performing an action, the robot needs to ensure various spatial constraints are met, such as that the parts to be put together are reachable, non occluded, etc. Such inferences are very complicated to support in logic theories, but specialized algorithms exist that efficiently compute qualitative spatial relations such as whether an object is reachable. In this work, we combine a logic-based planner for assembly tasks with geometric reasoning capabilities to enable robots to perform their tasks under spatial constraints. The geometric reasoner is integrated into the logic-based reasoning through decision procedures attached to symbols in the ontology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={This paper tackles the problem of generalizing robot control programs over multiple objects, tasks and environments, based on the concept of action descriptions. These are abstract, general, semantic descriptions of an action that are augmented during execution with subsymbolic parameters specific to the context at hand. The parameters are inferred through reasoning rules, which extract the context from the action description and the belief state of the robot. The proposed system scales well with increasing number of reasoning rules required to support the knowledge-intensive manipulation tasks. The architecture combines the high-level robot control program with the reasoning engine in a modular way, thus improving the scalability of the system. The approach is validated in the context of setting a table with a PR2 robot. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={With recent technological advances, robotic agents are increasingly capable of performing ever more sophisticated manipulation tasks. Perceptual capabilities of these robots need to be able to adapt to the wide variety of tasks they are to perform. Remembering what a robot has seen, what the rationale was behind the decisions it took or how it ended up understanding the world as it did, are important questions if we want perception capabilities that can scale towards real-world manipulation. We present a robotic perception system that generates perceptual episodic memories during the execution of a task. To allow easy retrieval of these memories we introduce an object and scene description language that serves as a layer of abstraction between the structure of the perception logs and the semantic interpretation of these. The description language can be used through a query interface to retrieve specific parts of the generated episodic memory. The purpose of the proposed system is two-fold: to enable on-line retrospection and specialized training of perception routines and to enable researchers to interactively explore perception results. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Robotic agents that do everyday manipulation tasks can hugely benefit from being able to predict consequences of their actions just before the execution. However, such a simulation technique is usually computationally-expensive and may not be achieved with agents' self computing power. For this problem, cloud robotics may offer a solution. Cloud robotics is an emerging field in the intersection of robotics and cloud computing which enables robots to access a greater amount of processing power and storage capacity than it can employ within itself. In this work, we introduce a mental simulation service to, one of the cloud engines, openEASE [1]. Using this service, researchers and robots can describe the world model, the state of the agent and the problem that is being dealt with. In return, it simulates the world and runs a learning algorithm and suggests a solution how the robotic agent can handle the problem. This service does not only offer a free remote access to simulation which is computationally expensive but also thanks to OPEnEASE's rich reasoning techniques these simulated experiments can be reasoned later on using prolog queries. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigate the task of recognizing objects of daily use in human environments purely based on object descriptions given in natural language. In particular, we present an approach to transform phrases stated in natural language that describe such objects by their visual appearance into formal, semantic representations of their perceptual characteristics, which in turn can be used in a robot perception system in order to identify objects that the robot has never encountered before. To this end, we learn probabilistic first-order knowledge bases from encyclopedic articles and online dictionaries, which contain textual descriptions of a vast amount of everyday objects. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach on a robotic system in a proof-of-concept evaluation on a selected set of object descriptions acquired from the internet. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={As autonomous, mobile robots are increasingly entering our everyday lives and the tasks they are to perform are getting continuously more complex and versatile, instructing robots by means of natural-language commands becomes more and more important. Such instructions, stated by humans and originally intended for human use, are typically formulated very vaguely and lack critical information about how to perform particular actions. Probabilistic relational models have shown promise in filling in missing information pieces that have been omitted in such instructions. However, the enormous size of these models and the computational expense in learning and reasoning often impedes their practical applicability to real-world domains. In this work, we propose a novel instance-based learning approach towards building up knowledge bases for instruction completion, which combines probabilistic methods with semantic analogical reasoning. Probabilistic reasoning is employed to build up a knowledge base of natural-language instruction sheets, while instruction completion can be achieved through fast database queries. We showcase the scalabilty of our approach by building up a KB of more than 100,000 instruction steps that have been mined from the wikihow.com web site and which are publicly accessible from within the Prac [21] natural-language interpreter. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to robustly perform tasks based on abstract instructions, robots need sophisticated knowledge processing methods. These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution. For filling these information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources, and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base. To this end we propose the KNOWROB knowledge processing system for robots. In this article, we discuss why the requirements of a robot knowledge processing system differ from what is commonly investigated in AI research, and propose to re-consider a KR system as a semantically annotated view on information and algorithms that are often already available as part of the robot's control system. We then introduce representational structures and a common vocabulary for representing knowledge about robot actions, events, objects, environments, and the robot's hardware as well as inference procedures that operate on this common representation. The KNOWROB system has been released as open-source software and is being used on several robots performing complex object manipulation tasks. We evaluate it through prototypical queries that demonstrate the expressive power and its impact on the robot's performance. © 2015},

abstract={Autonomous robots that are to perform complex everyday tasks such as making pancakes have to understand how the effects of an action depend on the way the action is executed. Within Artificial Intelligence, classical planning reasons about whether actions are executable, but makes the assumption that the actions will succeed (with some probability). In this work, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a framework that allows us to envision the physical effects of robot manipulation actions. We consider envisioning to be a qualitative reasoning method that reasons about actions and their effects based on simulation-based projections. Thereby it allows a robot to infer what could happen when it performs a task in a certain way. This is achieved by translating a qualitative physics problem into a parameterized simulation problem; performing a detailed physics-based simulation of a robot plan; logging the state evolution into appropriate data structures; and then translating these sub-symbolic data structures into interval-based first-order symbolic, qualitative representations, called timelines. The result of the envisioning is a set of detailed narratives represented by timelines which are then used to infer answers to qualitative reasoning problems. By envisioning the outcome of actions before committing to them, a robot is able to reason about physical phenomena and can therefore prevent itself from ending up in unwanted situations. Using this approach, robots can perform manipulation tasks more efficiently, robustly, and flexibly, and they can even successfully accomplish previously unknown variations of tasks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, we present a framework that infers human activities from observations using semantic representations. The proposed framework can be utilized to address the difficult and challenging problem of transferring tasks and skills to humanoid robots. We propose a method that allows robots to obtain and determine a higher-level understanding of a demonstrator's behavior via semantic representations. This abstraction from observations captures the “essence” of the activity, thereby indicating which aspect of the demonstrator's actions should be executed in order to accomplish the required activity. Thus, a meaningful semantic description is obtained in terms of human motions and object properties. In addition, we validated the semantic rules obtained in different conditions, i.e., three different and complex kitchen activities: 1) making a pancake; 2) making a sandwich; and 3) setting the table. We present quantitative and qualitative results, which demonstrate that without any further training, our system can deal with time restrictions, different execution styles of the same task by several participants, and different labeling strategies. This means, the rules obtained from one scenario are still valid even for new situations, which demonstrates that the inferred representations do not depend on the task performed. The results show that our system correctly recognized human behaviors in real-time in around 87.44% of cases, which was even better than a random participant recognizing the behaviors of another human (about 76.68%). In particular, the semantic rules acquired can be used to effectively improve the dynamic growth of the ontology-based knowledge representation. Hence, this method can be used flexibly across different demonstrations and constraints to infer and achieve a similar goal to that observed. Furthermore, the inference capability introduced in this study was integrated into a joint space control loop for a humanoid robot, an iCub, for achieving similar goals to the human demonstrator online. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Neuroscience studies have shown that incorporating gaze view with third view perspective has a great influence to correctly infer human behaviors. Given the importance of both first and third person observations for the recognition of human behaviors, we propose a method that incorporates these observations in a technical system to enhance the recognition of human behaviors, thus improving beyond third person observations in a more robust human activity recognition system. First, we present the extension of our proposed semantic reasoning method by including gaze data and external observations as inputs to segment and infer human behaviors in complex real-world scenarios. Then, from the obtained results we demonstrate that the combination of gaze and external input sources greatly enhance the recognition of human behaviors. Our findings have been applied to a humanoid robot to online segment and recognize the observed human activities with better accuracy when using both input sources; for example, the activity recognition increases from 77% to 82% in our proposed pancake-making dataset. To provide completeness of our system, we have evaluated our approach with another dataset with a similar setup as the one proposed in this work, that is, the CMU-MMAC dataset. In this case, we improved the recognition of the activities for the egg scrambling scenario from 54% to 86% by combining the external views with the gaze information, thus showing the benefit of incorporating gaze information to infer human behaviors across different datasets. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Due to humans and robots complementary capabilities, mixed human-robot teams are considerably deployed in real-world settings. A favored communication means is the natural language used by humans that is still a challenge for robotic teammates. They need to understand the environment from the viewpoint of their human teammates in order to be able to translate the instructions received in the natural language into plans. To deal with human-robot teaming, we report the results from an empirical study in a visual search and rescue task application for mixed human-robot teams. We show how those results and ideas can be in-tepreted into robot action plans by using a cognition-enabled task interpretation system. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

abstract={Research into knowledge acquisition for robotic agents has looked at interpreting natural language instructions meant for humans into robot-executable programs; however, the ambiguities of natural language remain a challenge for such “translations”. In this paper, we look at a particular sort of ambiguity: the control flow structure of the program described by the natural language instruction. It is not always clear, when more conditional statements appear in a natural language instruction, which of the conditions are to be thought of as alternative options in the same test, and which belong to a code branch triggered by a previous conditional. We augment a system which uses probabilistic reasoning to identify the meaning of the words in a sentence with reasoning about action preconditions and effects in order to filter out non-sensical code structures. We test our system with sample instruction sheets inspired from analytical chemistry. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={With quickly progressing and increasingly complex robot control and reasoning systems, a large gap of practical real-world knowledge for robots needs to be filled. While two prominent directions exist, namely designing all knowledge manually, or completely bootstrapping it, we emphasize the combination of both: Starting with simple heuristics, we let robots explore a task, record memories, interpret their findings, and improve their own multi-modal understanding to better their own performance. In this work, wc present a software system for autonomous robots that allows them to learn task nuances, and make informed decisions based on experience. They store these comprehensive probabilistic models of any task they perform in a robot knowledge service, benefiting from a shared knowledge base and centralized, well-maintained reasoning algorithms. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

abstract={A commonsense understanding of the physical world will be crucial for the robots of the future as they strive to perform everyday activities and instructions formulated by human users in natural language. One mechanism that is believed to assist human cognition in commonsense reasoning is mental simulation, the envisioning of actions before they are performed. We therefore present a system integrating simulation of robot plans with probabilistic reasoning about natural-language instructions, to create a complete pipeline from instruction to execution to storing and analyzing results of the simulation. This integration allows the robotic system to efficiently infer knowledge about the physical world that would be tedious to specify by hand in a collection of logical statements. Our system will be available online1 for open use by researchers. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Future service robots are expected to achieve high-quality task performance for everyday household chores. Some of the most frequent tasks in this domain are related to wiping of surfaces, such as vacuuming the floor, sweeping dust, or cleaning windows. However, the performance for these tasks is not directly observable as small dirt particles, dust, and residual water are hardly perceivable by means of computer vision. In this work we propose to utilize haptic perception paired with a qualitative effect representation to reason about the task performance of robotic wiping motions despite poor visual information. In particular, we relate the desired contact force to the measured end-effector force in order to simulate the effect of previously executed wiping motions. This way we are not just able to distinguish good from bad contact situations, but also replan recovery motions w. r. t. the effect-space to accomplish the commanded cleaning task subsequently. We evaluate our approach in a set of experiments with the robot Rollin' Justin. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={For robotic agents to perform manipulation tasks in human environments at a human level or higher, they need to be able to relate the physical effects of their actions to how they are executing them; small variations in execution can have very different consequences. This paper proposes a framework for acquiring and applying action knowledge from naive user demonstrations in an interactive simulation environment under varying conditions. The framework combines a flexible constraint-based motion control approach with games-with-apurposebased learning using Random Forest Regression. The acquired action models are able to produce context-sensitive constraint-based motion descriptions to perform the learned action. A pouring experiment is conducted to test the feasibility of the suggested approach and shows the learned system can perform comparable to its human demonstrators. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This study presents a simple method that allows us to modify the composition, morphological, and surface properties of three-dimensional hierarchical Nb3O7(OH) superstructures, resulting in strongly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. The superstructures consist of highly ordered nanowire networks and self-assemble under hydrothermal conditions. The presence of titanium affects the morphology of the superstructures, resulting in increased surface areas for higher doping levels. Up to 12 at. % titanium is incorporated into the Nb3O7(OH) crystal lattice via substitution of niobium at its octahedral lattice sites. Further titanium excess results in the formation of niobium-doped TiO2 plates, which overgrow the surface of the Nb3O7(OH) superstructures. Photoluminescence spectroscopy indicates fewer charge recombination processes near the surface of the nanostructures with an increasing titanium concentration in the crystal lattice. The combination of larger surface areas with fewer quenching sites at the crystal surface yields higher H2 evolution rates for the doped samples, with the rate being doubled by incorporation of 5.5 ± 0.7 at. % Ti. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Mobile robots operating in a human environment face the challenge of recognizing objects that possess a multitude of different visual characteristics, affordances, and are found in visually challenging scenes. Because of this, perceptual capabilities of such robots need to go beyond detection or categorization of objects, and be able to answer queries not only about where certain objects are located based on their class label, but also about functional properties of these. To achieve an optimal performance, robots need to be aware of their environment, the task that they are to execute, and their perceptual capabilities. Given this knowledge, robotic agents need adequate mechanisms that apply the right method at the right time, in the right situation. In this paper we present a self-adaptive robotic perception system, that acts as a planner for task aware robot manipulation and enables querying on a broad domain. This is done through extending our existing perception framework, ROBOSHERLOCK, with the capability to adapt its perception pipelines based on the query, using knowledge-based reasoning. We will demonstrate the success of the approach, by presenting challenging queries, where the benefits of integrating knowledge processing into perception systems is shown. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we discuss how the combination of modern technologies in big data storage and management, knowledge representation and processing, cloud-based computation, and web technology can help the robotics community to establish and strengthen an open research discipline. We describe how we made the demonstrator of a EU project review openly available to the research community. Specifically, we recorded episodic memories with rich semantic annotations during a pizza preparation experiment in autonomous robot manipulation. Afterwards, we released them as an open knowledge base using the cloud- and web-based robot knowledge service OPEnEASE. We discuss several ways on how this open data can be used to validate our experimental reports and to tackle novel challenging research problems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Compliant manipulation is one of the grand challenges for autonomous robots. Many household chores in human environments, such as cleaning the floor or wiping windows, rely on this principle. At the same time these tasks often require whole-body motions to cover a larger workspace. The performance of the actual task itself is thereby dependent on a large number of parameters that have to be taken into account. To tackle this issue we propose to utilize low-level compliant whole-body control strategies parameterized by high-level hybrid reasoning mechanisms. We categorize compliant wiping actions in order to determine relevant control parameters. According to these parameters we set up process models for each identified wiping action and implement generalized control strategies based on human task knowledge. We evaluate our approach experimentally on three whole-body manipulation tasks, namely scrubbing a mug with a sponge, skimming a window with a window wiper and bi-manually collecting the shards of a broken mug with a broom. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The ability to build robotic agents that can perform everyday tasks heavily depends on understanding how humans perform them. In order to achieve close to human understanding of a task and generate a formal representation of it, it is important to jointly reason about the human actions and the objects that are being acted on. We present a robotic perception framework for perceiving actions performed by a human in a household environment that can be used to answer questions such as “which object did the human act on?” or “which actions did the human perform?”. To do this we extend the RoboSherlock framework with the capabilities of detecting humans and objects at the same time, while simultaneously reasoning about the possible actions that are being performed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Several tasks that autonomous service robots will be expected to do involve changing material objects by cutting or separating parts, then rearranging them to obtain assemblages satisfying certain properties. In this paper we describe a system to represent and reason about entities that disappear or are created by the robot through such actions. Entities are grounded in objects that the robot can perceive and manipulate, and reasoning provides specific parameters for the robot's actions. For this paper, our system has knowledge only of geometric aspects related to cutting and rearrangement of objects. We test our system in simulation, but also discuss how it can be connected to a robot's perception and control.

abstract={In this paper we present a cognition-enabled control framework for robot control in mixed human-robot teams performing rescue missions after avalanches. We could focus on two key reasoning mechanisms: First, reasoning about the robot capabilities, which allow them to make best use of the hardware and software components they are equipped with. Second, context-directed interpretation of vague commands, which enables the human leader of the rescue team to state tasks naturally. Simulation-based reasoning mechanisms then refine the vague and ambiguous instructions in the given capability context to appropriate task interpretations. We could show that by employing these reasoning mechanisms we can specify generic plans that automatically adapt themselves to the robotic agent executing them. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning technology involving, e.g., inference, planning, and learning, has a track record with a healthy number of successful applications. So can it be used as a toolbox of methods for autonomous mobile robots? Not necessarily, as reasoning on a mobile robot about its dynamic, partially known environment may differ substantially from that in knowledge-based pure software systems, where most of the named successes have been registered. Moreover, recent knowledge about the robot’s environment cannot be given a priori, but needs to be updated from sensor data, involving challenging problems of symbol grounding and knowledge base change. This chapter sketches the main robotics-relevant topics of symbol-based AI reasoning. Basic methods of knowledge representation and inference are described in general, covering both logic- and probability-based approaches. The chapter first gives a motivation by example, to what extent symbolic reasoning has the potential of helping robots perform in the first place. Then (Sect. 14.2), we sketch the landscape of representation languages available for the endeavor. After that (Sect. 14.3), we present approaches and results for several types of practical, robotics-related reasoning tasks, with an emphasis on temporal and spatial reasoning. Plan-based robot control is described in some more detail in Sect. 14.4. Section 14.5 concludes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.},

abstract={Universal robotic agents are envisaged to perform a wide range of manipulation tasks in everyday environments. A common action observed in many household chores is wiping, such as the absorption of spilled water with a sponge, skimming breadcrumbs off the dining table, or collecting shards of a broken mug using a broom. To cope with this versatility, the agents have to represent the tasks on a high level of abstraction. In this work, we propose to represent the medium in wiping tasks (e.g. water, breadcrumbs, or shards) as generic particle distribution. This representation enables us to represent wiping tasks as the desired state change of the particles, which allows the agent to reason about the effects of wiping motions in a qualitative manner. Based on this, we develop three prototypical wiping actions for the generic tasks of absorbing, collecting and skimming. The Cartesian wiping motions are resolved to joint motions exploiting the free degree of freedom of the involved tool. Furthermore, the workspace of the robotic manipulators is used to reason about the reachability of wiping motions. We evaluate our methods in simulated scenarios, as well as in a real experiment with the robotic agent Rollin' Justin.

abstract={Autonomous robots in unstructured and dynamically changing retail environments have to master complex perception, knowledge processing, and manipulation tasks. To enable them to act competently, we propose a framework based on three core components: (o) a knowledge-enabled perception system, capable of combining diverse information sources to cope with occlusions and stacked objects with a variety of textures and shapes, (o) knowledge processing methods produce strategies for tidying up supermarket racks, and (o) the necessary manipulation skills in confined spaces to arrange objects in semi-accessible rack shelves. We demonstrate our framework in an simulated environment as well as on a real shopping rack using a PR2 robot. Typical supermarket products are detected and rearranged in the retail rack, tidying up what was found to be misplaced items.

abstract={Towards life-long learning schemes for cognitive robots, having a human-like episodic memory structure and management is an important capability. By having this, they will have data from past experiences to carry such a learning process. In this paper, we show how this kind of detailed robot memories, such as the one described in [1], can be used to generate a video of the episode with semantic annotations. This methodology does not only prove that we have an adequately-detailed episodic memory structure for robots but also becomes a comprehensive tool for roboticists while analyzing, diagnosing and debugging how autonomous robots have behaved under certain conditions. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Robots performing general purpose plans must deal with a wide variety of contexts. Situations they encounter might differ only in subtle, but important details in context and parameterization that have a massive impact on an action's outcome. To avoid the effort of encoding all possible combinations of subtleties into plans, we present a prediction framework that gives robot agents an intuition of their actions' effects and for choosing parameter values that have proven to be useful before. We let a robot form these predictions and expectations from episodic memories collected during earlier plan executions, improving its own behavior with every new situation encountered. We evaluate and explain our approach using experiments performed on a PR2 robot performing complex mobile manipulation activities in a kitchen environment. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Predicting the outcome of an action can help a robot detect failures in advance, and schedule action replanning before an error occurs. We propose using an interactive physics based simulator with the aim of collecting realistic data to be used for learning. We then show how we save and query for specific information from the data more effectively. The data from the simulation is used to learn a failure detection model which is utilized by a real robot performing the same actions. We show that learning from simulation data is realistic enough to be applied on a real robot. The learning algorithm is more simple in design and outperforms the more complex one from our previous work. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Many household chores and industrial manufacturing tasks require a certain compliant behavior to make deliberate physical contact with the environment. This compliant behavior can be implemented by modern robotic manipulators. However, in order to plan the task execution, a robot requires generic process models of these tasks which can be adapted to different domains and varying environmental conditions. In this work we propose a classification of compliant manipulation tasks meeting these requirements, to derive related actions for automated planning. We also present a classification for the sub-category of wiping tasks, which are most common and of great importance in service robotics.We categorize actions from an object-centric perspective to make them independent of any specific robot kinematics. The aim of the proposed taxonomy is to guide robotic programmers to develop generic actions for any kind of robotic systems in arbitrary domains. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Teams of mobile robots can be deployed in search and rescue missions to explore previously unknown environments. Methods for joint localization and mapping constitute the basis for (semi-)autonomous cooperative action, in particular when navigating in GPS-denied areas. As communication losses may occur, a decentralized solution is required. With these challenges in mind, we designed a submap-based SLAM system that relies on inertial measurements and stereo-vision to create multi-robot dense 3D maps. For online pose and map estimation, we integrate the results of keyframe-based local reference filters through incremental graph SLAM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine these two methods to benefit from their particular advantages for 6D multi-robot localization and mapping: Local reference filters on each robot provide real-time, long-term stable state estimates that are required for stabilization, control and fast obstacle avoidance, whereas online graph optimization provides global multi-robot pose and map estimates needed for cooperative planning. We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios.

abstract={Autonomous mobile robots are employed to perform increasingly complex tasks which require appropriate task descriptions, accurate object recognition, and dexterous object manipulation. In this paper we will address three key questions: How to obtain appropriate task descriptions from natural language (NL) instructions, how to choose the control program to perform a task description, and how to recognize and manipulate the objects referred by a task description? We describe an evaluated robotic agent which takes a natural language instruction stating a step of DNA extraction procedure as a starting point. The system is able to transform the textual instruction into an abstract symbolic plan representation. It can reason about the representation and answer queries about what, how, and why it is done. The robot selects the most appropriate control programs and robustly coordinates all manipulations required by the task description. The execution is based on a perception sub-system which is able to locate and recognize the objects and instruments needed in the DNA extraction procedure. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous manipulation robots can be valuable AIDS as interactive agents in the home, yet it has proven extremely difficult to program their behavior. Imitation learning uses data on human demonstrations to build behavioral models for robots. In order to cover a wide range of action strategies, data from many individuals is needed. Acquiring such large amounts of data can be a challenge. Tools for data capturing in this domain must thus implement a good user experience. We propose to use human computation games in order to gather data on human manual behavior. We demonstrate the idea with a strategy game that is operated via a natural user interface. A comparison between using the game for action execution and demonstrating actions in a virtual environment shows that people interact longer and have a better experience when playing the game. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The recognition of humans in Kinect camera data is a crucial problem in many mechatronics applications with human-computer interaction. In order to improve the limited scope of many methods based on a kinematic or surface mesh model, we propose a spatiotemporal segmentation of keypoints provided by a skeletonization of depth contours. A vector-shaped pose descriptor allows for the retrieval of similar poses and is easier to use with many machine learning libraries. A visualization method based on the Hilbert curve provides valuable insight in the detected poses. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adapt to the number of people in a kitchen scenario, and track them over time. We were able to retrieve similar poses from a database and identify clusters in the dataset. By applying our method, the Princeton Tracking Benchmark, we demonstrated that our method is applicable in scenes where a human kinematic or surface mesh model would be overly restrictive. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The vision of the RoboEarth project is to design a knowledge-based system to provide web and cloud services that can transform a simple robot into an intelligent one. In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Advancements in Virtual Reality have enabled well-defined and consistent virtual environments that can capture complex scenarios, such as human everyday activities. Additionally, virtual simulators (such as SIGVerse) are designed to be user-friendly mechanisms between virtual robots/agents and real users allowing a better interaction. We envision such rich scenarios can be used to train robots to learn new behaviors specially in human everyday activities where a diverse variability can be found. In this paper, we present a multi-level framework that is capable to use different input sources such as cameras and virtual environments to understand and execute the demonstrated activities. Our presented framework first obtains the semantic models of human activities from cameras, which are later tested using the SIGVerse virtual simulator to show new complex activities (such as, cleaning the table) using a virtual robot. Our introduced framework is integrated on a real robot, i.e. an iCub, which is capable to process the signals from the virtual environment to then understand the activities performed by the observed robot. This was realized through the use of previous knowledge and experiences that the robot has learned from observing humans activities. Our results show that our framework was able to extract the meaning of the observed motions with 80% accuracy of recognition by obtaining the objects relationships given the current context via semantic representations to extract high-level understanding of those complex activities even when they represent different behaviors. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Robots that are to master everyday manipulation tasks need both: The ability to reason about actions, objects and action effects, and the ability to perform sophisticated movement control. To bridge the gap between these two worlds, we consider the problem of connecting symbolic action representation with strategies from motion control engineering. We present a system using the task function approach [1] to define a common symbolic movement description language which defines motions as sets of symbolic constraints. We define these constraints using geometric features, like points, lines, and planes, grounding the description in the visual percepts of the robot. Additionally, we propose to assemble task functions by stacking 1-D feature functions, which leads to a modular movement specification. We evaluate and validate our approach on the task of flipping pancakes with a robot, showcasing the robustness and flexibility of the proposed movement representation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a two-stage framework that deal with the problem of automatically extract human activities from videos. First, for action recognition we employ an unsupervised state-of-the-art learning algorithm based on Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA). This learning algorithm extracts spatio-temporal features directly from video data and it is computationally more efficient and robust than other unsupervised methods. Nevertheless, when applying this one-stage state-of-the-art action recognition technique on the observations of human everyday activities, it can only reach an accuracy rate of approximately 25%. Hence, we propose to enhance this process with a second stage, which define a new method to automatically generate semantic rules that can reason about human activities. The obtained semantic rules enhance the human activity recognition by reducing the complexity of the perception system and they allow the possibility of domain change, which can great improve the synthesis of robot behaviors. The proposed method was evaluated under two complex and challenging scenarios: making a pancake and making a sandwich. The difficulty of these scenarios is that they contain finer and more complex activities than the well known data sets (Hollywood2, KTH, etc). The results show benefits of two stages method, the accuracy of action recognition was significantly improved compared to a single-stage method (above 87% compared to human expert). This indicates the improvement of the framework using the reasoning engine for the automatic extraction of human activities from observations, thus, providing a rich mechanism for transferring a wide range of human skills to humanoid robots. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous robotic agents acting in open environments have to master situations and action effects they did not anticipate. To deal with these issues we propose an information processing concept for plan interpretation that is based on three concepts: statically defined, and dynamically inferred knowledge, context-definition on a task level to implicitly reparameterize all sub-actions during a task, and control structures for plans that can monitor plan execution for unexpected events and respond appropriately. Implications of plans realized according to these design patterns are explained on the example of a reasoning intense autonomous manipulation task.

abstract={Prospection lies at the core of cognition: it is the means by which an agent - a person or a cognitive robot - shifts its perspective from immediate sensory experience to anticipate future events, be they the actions of other agents or the outcome of its own actions. Prospection, accomplished by internal simulation, requires mechanisms for both perceptual imagery and motor imagery. While it is known that these two forms of imagery are tightly entwined in the mirror neuron system, we do not yet have an effective model of the mentalizing network which would provide a framework to integrate declarative episodic and procedural memory systems and to combine experiential knowledge with skillful know-how. Such a framework would be founded on joint perceptuo-motor representations. In this paper, we examine the case for this form of representation, contrasting sensory-motor theory with ideo-motor theory, and we discuss how such a framework could be realized by joint episodic-procedural memory. We argue that such a representation framework has several advantages for cognitive robots. Since episodic memory operates by recombining imperfectly recalled past experience, this allows it to simulate new or unexpected events. Furthermore, by virtue of its associative nature, joint episodic-procedural memory allows the internal simulation to be conditioned by current context, semantic memory, and the agent's value system. Context and semantics constrain the combinatorial explosion of potential perception-action associations and allow effective action selection in the pursuit of goals, while the value system provides the motives that underpin the agent's autonomy and cognitive development. This joint episodic-procedural memory framework is neutral regarding the final implementation of these episodic and procedural memories, which can be configured sub-symbolically as associative networks or symbolically as content-addressable image databases and databases of motor-control scripts. © 2015 Vernon, Beetz and Sandini.},

abstract={A major bottleneck in the realization of autonomous robotic agents performing complex manipulation tasks are the requirements that these tasks impose onto perception mechanisms. There is a strong need to scale robot perception capabilities along two dimensions: First, the variations of appearances and perceptual properties that real-world objects exhibit. Second, the variety of perceptual tasks, like categorizing and localizing, decomposing objects into their functional parts, perceiving the affordances they provide. This paper, addresses this need by organizing perception into a two-stage process. First, a pervasive and 'calm' perceptual component runs continually and interprets the incoming image stream to form a general purpose hybrid (symbolic/sub-symbolic) belief state. This is used by the second component, the task-directed perception subsystem, to perform the respective perception tasks in a more informed way. We describe and discuss the first component and explain how it can manage realistic belief states, form a memory of past perceptual experiences, and compute valuable perceptual attributes without delaying plan execution. It does so by exploiting that perception is not a one-shot task but rather a secondary task that is pervasively and calmly performed throughout the lifetime of the robot. We show system operating on a leading-edge manipulation platform. Copyright © 2015, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Making future autonomous robots capable of accomplishing human-scale manipulation tasks requires us to equip them with knowledge and reasoning mechanisms. We propose Open-EASE, a remote knowledge representation and processing service that aims at facilitating these capabilities. Open-EASE gives its users unprecedented access to the knowledge of leading-edge autonomous robotic agents. It also provides the representational infrastructure to make inhomogeneous experience data from robots and human manipulation episodes semantically accessible, and is complemented by a suite of software tools that enable researchers and robots to interpret, analyze, visualize, and learn from the experience data. Using Open-EASE users can retrieve the memorized experiences of manipulation episodes and ask queries regarding to what the robot saw, reasoned, and did as well as how the robot did it, why, and what effects it caused. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, we present and demonstrate that with an appropriate semantic representation and even with a very naive perception system, it is sufficient to infer human activities from observations. First, we present a method to extract the semantic rules of human everyday activities. Namely, we extract low-level information from the sensor data and then we infer the high-level by reasoning about the intended human behaviors. The advantage of this abstract representation is that it allows us to obtain more generic models from human behaviors, even when the information is obtained from different scenarios. Another important aspect of our system is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Our system has been fully implemented on a humanoid robot, the iCub, to experimentally validate the performance and the robustness of our system during on-line execution within the control loop of the robot. The results show that the robot is able to make a decision in 0.12 s about the inferred human behaviors with a recognition accuracy of 85%. © 2015 Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan.},

abstract={Autonoumous robotic agents performing human-scale manipulation activities in open environments will need extensive knowledge processing capabilities. In previous work we presented OpenEASE, an online knowledge representation and reasoning framework with interfaces for both autonomous agent systems and robotics researchers. We propose to hold an interactive session during AAMAS 2015 to show researchers from the robotic agents community how to use the web interface of OpenEASE. The demonstration will feature two datasets recorded on leading-edge mobile manipulation platforms: A robotic mobile pick-and-place scenario, and an experiment in which a safety-aware robotic agent physically interacts with a human co-worker. Participants will learn how to use the expressive Prolog-based query language of OpenEASE to analyse the comprehensive datasets available in the system.

abstract={This article describes interactive object segmentation for autonomous service robots acting in human living environments. The proposed system allows a robot to effectively segment textured and textureless objects in cluttered scenes by leveraging its manipulation capabilities. In this interactive perception approach, RGB and depth (RGB-D) camera based features are tracked while the robot actively induces motions into a scene using its arm. The robot autonomously infers appropriate arm movements which can effectively separate objects. The resulting tracked feature trajectories are assigned to their corresponding object by clustering. In the final step, we reconstruct the dense models of the objects from the previously clustered sparse RGB-D features. The approach is integrated with robotic grasping and is demonstrated on scenes consisting of various textured and textureless objects, showing the advantages of a tight integration between perception, cognition and action. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={A pressing question when designing intelligent autonomous systems is how to integrate the various subsystems concerned with complementary tasks. Robotic vision must provide task relevant information about the environment and the objects in it to various planning related modules. In most implementations of the traditional Perception-Cognition-Action paradigm these tasks are treated as quasi-independent modules that function as black boxes for each other. Often these subsystems are running in completely different frameworks, with a thin communication interface or middle-ware between them. While each subproblem poses specific requirements that can make fusing them more challenging, perception can benefit tremendously from a tight collaboration with cognition. In the following, a common framework for cognitive perception, based on the principle of unstructured information management (UIM) will be presented, called RoboSherlock. UIM has proven itself to be a powerful paradigm for scaling intelligent information and question answering systems towards real-world complexity. Complexity in UIM is handled by identifying (or hypothesizing) pieces of structured information by applying ensembles of experts for annotating information pieces, and by testing and integrating these isolated annotations into a comprehensive interpretation.

abstract={Low-cost game controllers such as Microsoft's Kinect sensor provide dense, real-time depth measurements of indoor environments at high framerate. The sensor is based on the principle of active stereo using structured infrared light. For surfaces that distract infrared light, no measurements can be obtained. It is important to replace missing values early on, to avoid a slow subsequent conditional evaluations or the propagation of errors into neighboring regions. To solve this problem we present an inpainting method that adds missing values based on background estimates of the unoccluded scene. It is therefore not necessary to hypothesize missing regions based on similarity to other image regions. The procedure also avoids a blurring between foreground and background. By adapting the method to the specific properties of the Kinect (and comparable) cameras, we were able to keep the complexity of the algorithm low, so high speed can be achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Pose uncertainty is ubiquitous in mobile manipulation. It's important to realize that both positional and temporal errors will ultimately result in positional misalignment when objects are in motion. In order to judge how given translational, rotational and temporal variance affects a task at hand, they are combined and propagated to a coordinate frame that is relevant to the task. Typically, approaches for uncertainty propagation treat the world as quasi-static. We are presenting a framework that treats time adequately by two additions. Firstly, queries that span over a time interval are supported, such as 'where would object Oa that was observed at time T0 be located with respect to the robot pose at time T1 and what is its pose belief distribution'. Secondly, uncertainty in time is supported, such as when we need to reason about the probability distribution of an object that was observed with a sensor that doesn't provide accurate timestamps. The library is open source, fully integrated with the ROS ecosystem and offers simple to use and performant interfaces. © VDE VERLAG GMBH Berlin Offenbach.},

abstract={We investigate the perception and reasoning task of answering queries about realistic scenes with objects of daily use perceived by a robot. A key problem implied by the task is the variety of perceivable properties of objects, such as their shape, texture, color, size, text pieces and logos, that go beyond the capabilities of individual state-of-the-art perception methods. A promising alternative is to employ combinations of more specialized perception methods. In this paper we propose a novel combination method, which structures perception in a two-step process, and apply this method in our object perception system. In a first step, specialized methods annotate detected object hypotheses with symbolic information pieces. In the second step, the given query Q is answered by inferring the conditional probability P(Q - E), where E are the symbolic information pieces considered as evidence for the conditional probability. In this setting Q and E are part of a probabilistic model of scenes, objects and their annotations, which the perception method has beforehand learned a joint probability distribution of. Our proposed method has substantial advantages over alternative methods in terms of the generality of queries that can be answered, the generation of information that can actively guide perception, the ease of extension, the possibility of including additional kinds of evidences, and its potential for the realization of self-improving and - specializing perception systems. We show for object categorization, which is a subclass of the probabilistic inferences, that impressive categorization performance can be achieved combining the employed expert perception methods in a synergistic manner. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In many cases, the success of a manipulation action performed by a robot is determined by how it is executed and by how the robot moves during the action. Examples are tasks such as unscrewing a bolt, pouring liquids and flipping a pancake. This aspect is often abstracted away in AI planning and action languages that assume that an action is successful as long as all preconditions are fulfilled. In this paper we investigate how constraint-based motion representations used in robot control can be combined with a semantic knowledge base in order to let a robot reason about movements and to automatically generate executable motion descriptions that can be adapted to different robots, objects and tools. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={In order to manage complex tasks such as cooking, future robots need to be action-aware and posses common sense knowledge. For example flipping a pancake requires a robot to know that a spatula has to be under a pancake in order to succeed. We present a novel approach for the extraction and learning of action and common sense knowledge, and developed a game using a robot-simulator with realistic physics for data acquisition. The game environment is a virtual kitchen, in which a user has to create a pancake by pouring pancake-mix on an oven and flipping it using a spatula. The interaction is done by controlling a virtual robot hand with a 3D input sensor. We incorporate a realistic fluid simulation in order to gather appropriate data of the pouring action. Furthermore, we present a task outcome prediction algorithm for this specific system and show how to learn a failure model for the pouring and flipping action. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Automatically segmenting and recognizing human activities from observations typically requires a very complex and sophisticated perception algorithm. Such systems would be unlikely implemented on-line into a physical system, such as a robot, due to the pre-processing step(s) that those vision systems usually demand. In this work, we present and demonstrate that with an appropriate semantic representation of the activity, and without such complex perception systems, it is sufficient to infer human activities from videos. First, we will present a method to extract the semantic rules based on three simple hand motions, i.e. move, not move and tool use. Additionally, the information of the object properties either ObjectActedOn or ObjectInHand are used. Such properties encapsulate the information of the current context. The above data is used to train a decision tree to obtain the semantic rules employed by a reasoning engine. This means, we extract lower-level information from videos and we reason about the intended human behaviors (high-level). The advantage of the abstract representation is that it allows to obtain more generic models out of human behaviors, even when the information is obtained from different scenarios. The results show that our system correctly segments and recognizes human behaviors with an accuracy of 85%. Another important aspect of our system is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Our system has been fully implemented on a humanoid robot, the iCub to experimentally validate the performance and the robustness of our system during on-line execution of the robot. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach for 3D geometry-based object categorization in cluttered table-top scenes. In our method, objects are decomposed into different geometric parts whose spatial arrangement is represented by a graph. The matching and searching of graphs representing the objects is sped up by using a hash table which contains possible spatial configurations of the different parts that constitute the objects. Additive feature descriptors are used to label partially or completely visible object parts. In this work we categorize objects into five geometric shapes: sphere, box, flat, cylindrical, and disk/plate, as these shapes represent the majority of objects found on tables in typical households. Moreover, we reconstruct complete 3D models that include the invisible back-sides of objects as well, in order to facilitate manipulation by domestic service robots. Finally, we present an extensive set of experiments on point clouds of objects using an RGBD camera, and our results highlight the improvements over previous methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper proposes a robot recommender system, which uses a hybrid filtering method based on n-gram affective event model. Nowadays there are strong tendency to utilize a robot for educational services, which can provide educational contents to enhances individual student's motivation. However, the current service robots can be more holistic systems to offer personalized robotic services to satisfy every individuals by reflecting their preferences. Here, robotic service can be another field to meet personal need. Hybrid approaches of personalization technology that combine collaborative filtering approaches and content-based approaches are proposed over the last decade. Especially, n-gram based approaches are proposed to utilize sequential information from very large data sets. This paper suggests an extends affective event model and its n-gram model combining fact semantic knowledge, event episodic knowledge and emotion. To show the validity of the proposed approach, we applied the scenario of English learning. The experiment results shows that an educational service robot recommend two students as different content types, even though they miss same question. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Teaching robots everyday tasks like making pancakes by instructions requires interfaces that can be intuitively operated by non-experts. By performing novel manipulation tasks in a virtual environment using a data glove task-related information of the demonstrated actions can directly be accessed and extracted from the simulator. We translate low-level data structures of these simulations into meaningful first-order representations whereby we are able to select data segments and analyze them at an abstract level. Hence, the proposed system is a powerful tool for acquiring examples of manipulation actions and for analyzing them whereby robots can be informed how to perform a task. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, there has been growing interest in enabling robots to use task instructions from the Internet and to share tasks they have learned with each other. To competently use, select and combine such instructions, robots need to be able to find out if different instructions describe the same task, which parts of them are similar and which ones differ. In this paper, we investigate techniques for automatically aligning symbolic task descriptions. We propose to adapt and extend established algorithms for sequence alignment that are commonly used in bioinformatics in order to make them applicable to robot action specifications. The extensions include methods for the comparison of complex sequence elements, for taking the semantic similarity of actions into account, and for aligning descriptions at different levels of granularity. We evaluate the algorithm on two large datasets of observations of human everyday tasks and show that they are able to align action sequences performed by different subjects in very different ways. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Planning for autonomous robots differs from classical planning, because actions are not behaving deterministically. In a real world environment there are too many parameters and too many cases to handle before the plan execution. Nevertheless planning is needed to give robots the flexibility to work in unknown or not completely known environments. Plan execution can be seen as a flexible way of handling unknown and/or changing environments. Here, during runtime, sensors and reasoners can be asked to give necessary information. To cover the uncertainty in the real world, there is need for more than pure logical reasoning. In order to close this gap, we want to extend the CRAM Plan Language (CPL) so that it can ask probabilistic world models which is the best way to continue under the current conditions and beliefs. These world models should be ultimately learned and trained autonomously by the robot. For this the robot needs to log data in an appropriate way as well as use this data to infer a world model and train it. But it is not feasible to learn one model of the whole world. It looks much more promising to use a combined approach of defining and learning a hierarchical model of the world. To start with small parts during a plan execution and learning methods to increase the success rate for these parts can be a starting point. In this paper a first proof of concept of how such a model can automatically be found and learned is presented.},

abstract={Robotic environment exploration in cluttered environments is a challenging problem. The number and variety of objects present not only make perception very difficult but also introduce many constraints for robot navigation and manipulation. In this paper, we investigate the idea of exploring a small, bounded environment (e.g., the shelf of a home refrigerator) by prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation of the objects it contains. The presence of multiple objects results in partial and occluded views of the scene. This inherent uncertainty in the scene's state forces the robot to adopt an observe-plan-act strategy and interleave planning with execution. Objects occupying the space and potentially occluding other hidden objects are rearranged to reveal more of the unseen area. The environment is considered explored when the state (free or occupied) of every voxel in the volume is known. The presented algorithm can be easily adapted to real world problems like object search, taking inventory, and mapping. We evaluate our planner in simulation using various metrics like planning time, number of actions required, and length of planning horizon. We then present an implementation on the PR2 robot and use it for object search in clutter. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Today's robots are still lacking comprehensive knowledge bases about objects and their properties. Yet, a lot of knowledge is required when performing manipulation tasks to identify abstract concepts like a 'handle' or the 'blade of a spatula' and to ground them into concrete coordinate frames that can be used to parametrize the robot's actions. In this paper, we present a system that enables robots to use CAD models of objects as a knowledge source and to perform logical inference about object components that have automatically been identified in these models. The system includes several algorithms for mesh segmentation and geometric primitive fitting which are integrated into the robot's knowledge base as procedural attachments to the semantic representation. Bottom-up segmentation methods are complemented by top-down, knowledge-based analysis of the identified components. The evaluation on a diverse set of object models, downloaded from the Internet, shows that the algorithms are able to reliably detect several kinds of object parts. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Temporal projection is the computational problem of predicting what will happen when a robot executes its plan. Temporal projection for everyday manipulation tasks such as table setting and cleaning is a challenging task. Symbolic projection methods developed in Artificial Intelligence are too abstract to reason about how to place objects such that they do not hinder future actions. Simulation-based projection is fine-grained enough but computationally too expensive as it is not able to abstract away from the execution of uninteresting actions (such as navigation). In this paper we propose a novel temporal projection mechanism that combines the strengths of both approaches: it is able to abstract away from the execution of continuous but uninteresting actions and provides the realism and fine grainedness needed to reason about critical situations. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a method to learn the partially-ordered structure inherent in human everyday activities from observations by exploiting variability in the data. Using statistical relational learning, the system extracts a full-joint probability distribution over the actions that form a task, their (partial) ordering, and their properties. Relevant action properties and relations among actions are learned as those that are consistent among the observations. The models can be used for classifying action sequences, for determining which actions are relevant for a task, which objects are usually manipulated, and which action properties are typical for a person. We evaluate the approach on synthetic data sampled from partial-order trees as well as two real-world data sets of humans activities: the TUM kitchen data set and the CMU MMAC data set. The results show that our approach outperforms sequence-based models like Conditional Random Fields for classifying observations of activities that allow a large amount of variation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a textureless object segmentation approach for autonomous service robots acting in human living environments. The proposed system allows a robot to effectively segment textureless objects in cluttered scenes by leveraging its manipulation capabilities. In our pipeline, the cluttered scenes are first statically segmented using state-of-the-art classification algorithm and then the interactive segmentation is deployed in order to resolve this possibly ambiguous static segmentation. In the second step the RGBD (RGB + Depth) sparse features, estimated on the RGBD point cloud from the Kinect sensor, are extracted and tracked while motion is induced into a scene. Using the resulting feature poses, the features are then assigned to their corresponding objects by means of a graph-based clustering algorithm. In the final step, we reconstruct the dense models of the objects from the previously clustered sparse RGBD features. We evaluated the approach on a set of scenes which consist of various textureless flat (e.g. box-like) and round (e.g. cylinder-like) objects and the combinations thereof. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The community-based generation of content has been tremendously successful in the World-Wide Web - people help each other by providing information that could be useful to others. We are trying to transfer this approach to robotics in order to help robots acquire the vast amounts of knowledge needed to competently perform everyday tasks. ROBOEARTH is intended to be a web community by robots for robots to autonomously share descriptions of tasks they have learned, object models they have created, and environments they have explored. In this paper, we report on the formal language we developed for encoding this information and present our approaches to solve the inference problems related to finding information, to determining if information is usable by a robot, and to grounding it on the robot platform. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this chapter, we focus on the human robot joint interaction application where robots can extract the useful multiple features from human faces. The idea follows daily life scenarios where humans rely mostly on face to face interaction and interpret gender, identity, facial behavior and age of the other persons at a very first glance. We term this problem as face-at-a-glance problem. The proposed solution to this problem is the development of a 3D photorealistic face model in real time for human facial analysis. We also discuss briefly some outstanding challenges like head poses, facial expressions and illuminations for image synthesis. Due to the diversity of the application domain and optimization of relevant information extraction for computer vision applications, we propose to solve this problem using an interdisciplinary 3D face model. The model is built using computer vision and computer graphics tools with image processing techniques. In order to trade off between accuracy and efficiency, we choose wireframe model which provides automatic face generation in real time. The goal of this chapter is to provide a standalone and comprehensive framework to extract useful multi-feature from a 3D model. Such features due to their wide range of information and less computational power, finds their applications in several advanced camera mounted technical systems. Although this chapter focuses on multi-feature extraction approach for human faces in interactive applications with intelligent systems, however the scope of this chapter is equally useful for researchers and industrial practitioner working in the modeling of 3D deformable objects. The chapter mainly specified to human faces but can also be applied to other applications like medical imaging, industrial robot manipulation and action recognition. © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Autonomous service robots will have to understand vaguely described tasks, such as "set the table" or "clean up". Performing such tasks as intended requires robots to fully, precisely, and appropriately parameterize their low-level control programs. We propose knowledge processing as a computational resource for enabling robots to bridge the gap between vague task descriptions and the detailed information needed to actually perform those tasks in the intended way. In this article, we introduce the KnowRob knowledge processing system that is specifically designed to provide autonomous robots with the knowledge needed for performing everyday manipulation tasks. The system allows the realization of "virtual knowledge bases": collections of knowledge pieces that are not explicitly represented but computed on demand from the robot's internal data structures, its perception system, or external sources of information. This article gives an overview of the different kinds of knowledge, the different inference mechanisms, and interfaces for acquiring knowledge from external sources, such as the robot's perception system, observations of human activities, Web sites on the Internet, as well as Web-based knowledge bases for information exchange between robots. We evaluate the system's scalability and present different integrated experiments that show its versatility and comprehensiveness. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={The power of fractal computation has been mainly exploited for image compression and halftoning. Here, we consider it for finding a fast approximate solution for the fundamental problem of nearest neighbour computation in the image plane. Traditional solutions use Delaunay triangulations or hierarchies (for the case of optimal solutions) or kd-trees for approximate ones. In contrast, we use a space-filling Hilbert curve which allows us to reduce the problem from 2D to 1D. The Hilbert curve has already been used to optimise high-dimensional nearest neighbour queries in the context of data base systems. In this paper, we propose a simplified solution that fits better to the computer vision context. We show that our algorithms solve two particular nearest neighbor problems efficiently. We provide practical results on the accuracy of the method and show that it is significantly faster than a kd-tree.},

abstract={Real world heterogeneous scenes contain objects of a large variety of forms, surfaces, colors and textures, thus multi-modal approaches are needed to deal with their challenges. A promising method of combining various sources of information are ensemble methods which allow on the fly integration of classification modules, specific to a single sensor modality, into a classification process. These modular and extensible approaches have the advantage that they do not require that a single method copes with every eventuality, but combine existing specialized methods to overcome their weaknesses. In addition, the rapid growth of the perception field means that comparing, evaluating, sharing and combining the available approaches becomes increasingly relevant. In this article we describe a novel training strategy for ensembles of strong learners that not only outperform the best member but also the best classifier trained on the concatenation of features. The method was evaluated using a large RGBD dataset containing Kinect scans of 300 objects and special use-cases are presented that highlight how ensemble learning can be used to improve classification results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Mobile manipulation robots are becoming more and more common and begin to extend their task spectrum towards more general housework activities. The sequence of actions needed to accomplish such tasks can be obtained from instructions on the Internet originally written for humans. While giving valuable information about the types of actions and some of their parameters, these instructions usually lack information that humans consider to be obvious. In this paper, we investigate how we can equip robots with sufficient knowledge and inference mechanisms to competently detect and fill such knowledge gaps in descriptions of everyday activities. We present methods for projecting the effects of actions and processes, for inferring action parameters like the objects and locations to be used, and introduce representations for reasoning about object transformations resulting from the effects of actions. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we discuss the problem of action-specific knowledge processing, representation and acquisition by autonomous robots performing everyday activities. We report on a thorough analysis of the household domain, which has been performed on a large corpus of natural-language instructions from the Web and underlines the supreme need of action-specific knowledge for robots acting in those environments. We introduce the concept of Probabilistic Robot Action Cores (PRAC) that are well-suited for encoding such knowledge in a probabilistic first-order knowledge base. We additionally show how such a knowledge base can be acquired by natural language and we address the problems of incompleteness, underspecification and ambiguity of naturalistic action specifications and point out how PRAC models can tackle those. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel oversegmentation technique for RGB-D images. The visible surface of the 3D geometry is partitioned into uniformly distributed and equally sized planar patches. This results in a classic over-segmentation of pixels into depth-adaptive superpixels which correctly reflect deformation through perspective projection. The advantages of depth-adaptive superpixels (DASP) are demonstrated by using spectral graph theory to create image segmentations in near realtime. Our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art oversegmentation and image segmentation algorithms both in quality and runtime. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an algorithm to detect and describe features of surface textures, similar to SIFT and SURF. In contrast to approaches solely based on the intensity image, it uses depth information to achieve invariance with respect to arbitrary changes of the camera pose. The algorithm works by constructing a scale space representation of the image which conserves the real-world size and shape of texture features. In this representation, keypoints are detected using a Difference-of-Gaussian response. Normal-aligned texture descriptors are then computed from the intensity gradient, normalizing the rotation around the normal using a gradient histogram. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of planar textured scenes and show that it outperforms SIFT and SURF under large viewpoint changes. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.},

Most robots currently have very limited perception in their manipulators, typically only fingertip position and velocity. Additional sensors make richer interactions with the objects possible. In this paper, we present a versatile, robust and low cost sensor for robot fingertips, that can improve robotic grasping and manipulation in several ways: 3D reconstruction of the shape of objects, material surface classification, and object slip detection. We extended TUM-Rosie, our robot for mobile manipulation, with fingertip sensors on its humanoid robotic hand, and show the advantages of the fingertip sensor integrated in our robot system. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article we investigate the representation and acquisition of Semantic Objects Maps (SOMs) that can serve as information resources for autonomous service robots performing everyday manipulation tasks in kitchen environments. These maps provide the robot with information about its operation environment that enable it to perform fetch and place tasks more efficiently and reliably. To this end, the semantic object maps can answer queries such as the following ones: 'What do parts of the kitchen look like?', 'How can a container be opened and closed?', 'Where do objects of daily use belong?', 'What is inside of cupboards/drawers?', etc. The semantic object maps presented in this article, which we call SOM+, extend the first generation of SOMs presented by Rusu et al. [1] in that the representation of SOM+ is designed more thoroughly and that SOM+ also include knowledge about the appearance and articulation of furniture objects. Also, the acquisition methods for SOM+ substantially advance those developed in [1] in that SOM+ are acquired autonomously and with low-cost (Kinect) instead of very accurate (laser-based) 3D sensors. In addition, perception methods are more general and are demonstrated to work in different kitchen environments. © 2012 IEEE.},

The goal of SHERPA is to develop a mixed ground and aerial robotic platform to support search and rescue activities in a real-world hostile environment, like the alpine scenario that is specifically targeted in the project. Looking into the technological platform and the alpine rescuing scenario, we plan to address a number of research topics about cognition and control. What makes the project potentially very rich from a scientific viewpoint is the heterogeneity and the capabilities to be owned by the different actors of the SHERPA system: the human rescuer is the 'busy genius', working in team with the ground vehicle, as the 'intelligent donkey', and with the aerial platforms, i.e. the 'trained wasps' and 'patrolling hawks'. Indeed, the research activity focuses on how the 'busy genius' and the 'SHERPA animals' interact and collaborate with each other, with their own features and capabilities, toward the achievement of a common goal. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Detecting objects in clutter is an important capability for a household robot executing pick and place tasks in realistic settings. While approaches from 2D vision work reasonably well under certain lighting conditions and given unique textures, the development of inexpensive RGBD cameras opens the way for real-time geometric approaches that do not require templates of known objects. This paper presents a part-graph-based hashing method for classifying objects in clutter, using an additive feature descriptor. The method is incremental, allowing easy addition of new training data without recreating the complete model, and takes advantage of the additive nature of the feature to increase efficiency. It is based on a graph representation of the scene created from considering possible groupings of over-segmented scene parts, which can in turn be used in classification. Additionally, the results over multiple segmentations can be accumulated to increase detection accuracy. We evaluated our approach on a large RGBD dataset containing over 15000 Kinect scans of 102 objects grouped in 16 categories, which we arranged into six geometric classes. Furthermore, tests on complete cluttered scenes were performed as well, and used to showcase the importance of domain adaptation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Automatically observing and understanding human activities is one of the big challenges in computer vision research. Among the potential fields of application are areas such as robotics, human computer interaction or medical research. In this article we present our work on unintrusive observation and interpretation of human activities for the precise recognition of human fullbody motions. The presented system requires no more than three cameras and is capable of tracking a large spectrum of motions in a wide variety of scenarios. This includes scenarios where the subject is partially occluded, where it manipulates objects as part of its activities, or where it interacts with the environment or other humans. Our system is self-training, i.e. it is capable of learning models of human motion over time. These are used both to improve the prediction of human dynamics and to provide the basis for the recognition and interpretation of observed activities. The accuracy and robustness obtained by our system is the combined result of several contributions. By taking an anthropometric human model and optimizing it towards use in a probabilistic tracking framework we obtain a detailed biomechanical representation of human shape, posture and motion. Furthermore, we introduce a sophisticated hierarchical sampling strategy for tracking that is embedded in a probabilistic framework and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian methods.We then show how to track complex manipulation activities in everyday environments using a combination of learned human appearance models and implicit environment models. Finally, we discuss a locally consistent representation of human motion that we use as a basis for learning environment- and taskspecific motion models. All methods presented in this article have been subject to extensive experimental evaluation on today's benchmarks and several challenging sequences ranging from athletic exercises to ergonomic case studies to everyday manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={Successfully accomplishing everyday manipulation tasks requires robots to have substantial knowledge about the objects they interact with, the environment they operate in as well as about the properties and effects of the actions they perform. Often, this knowledge is implicitly contained in manually written control programs, which makes it hard for the robot to adapt to newly acquired information or to re-use knowledge in a different context. By explicitly representing this knowledge, control decisions can be formulated as inference tasks which can be sent as queries to a knowledge base. This allows the robot to take all information it has at query time into account to generate answers, leading to better flexibility, adaptability to changing situations, robustness, and the ability to re-use knowledge once acquired. In this paper, we report on our work towards a practical and grounded knowledge representation and inference system. The system is specifically designed to meet the challenges created by using knowledge processing techniques on autonomous robots, including specialized inference methods, grounding of symbolic knowledge in the robot's control structures, and the acquisition of the different kinds of knowledge a robot needs.

abstract={Face recognition is one of the widely studied topics in the literature image processing and pattern recognition. Generally for the face images, the distance between camera and face is larger than the face size, hence in practice the effects of perspective distortions on the face edges are often ignored by the researchers. Hile these effects become more prominent if faces are viewed from different angles. In this paper, we study effects of perspective distortion and obtain improved results or face recognition against varying view-points. The approach follows by fitting a 3D model to the face images and creating a texture map by texture rectification at each triangle level. We compare our results with active appearance models (AAM) on two tandard face databases.},

abstract={Human faces are 3D complex objects consisting of geometrical and appearance variations. They exhibit local and global variations when observed over time. In our daily life communication, human faces are seen in actions conveying a set of information during interaction. Cognitive science explains that human brains are capable of extracting this set of information very efficiently resulting in a better interaction with others. Our goal is to extract a single feature set which represents multiple facial characteristics. This problem is addressed by the analysis of different feature components on facial classifications using a 3D surface model. We propose a unified framework which is capable to extract multiple information from the human faces and at the same time robust against rigid and non-rigid facial deformations. A single feature vector corresponding to a given image is representative of person's identity, facial expressions, gender and age estimation. This feature set is called spatio-temporal multifeature (STMF) extracted from image sequences. An STMF is configured with three different feature components which is tested thoroughly to evidence its validity. The experimental results from four different databases show that this feature set provides high accuracy and at the same time exhibits robustness. The results have been discussed comparatively with different approaches. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We suggest to use modular position- and force constraints, which are represented as action-object-object triples on the symbolic side and as task function parameters on the controller side. This description is a considerably more fine-grained interface than what has been seen in high-level robot control systems before. It can preserve the 'null space' of the task and make it available to the control level. We demonstrate how a symbolic description can be translated to a control-level description that is executable on the robot. We describe the relation to existing robot knowledge bases and indicate information sources for generating constraints on the symbolic side. On the control side we then show how our approach outperforms a traditional controller, by exploiting the task's null space, leading to a significantly extended work space. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe our approach to dealing with cluttered scenes of simple objects in the context of common pickand- place tasks for assistive robots. We consider the case when the robot enters an unknown environment, meaning that it does not know about the shape and size of the objects it should expect. Having no complete model of the objects makes detection through matching impossible, thus we propose an alternative approach to deal with unknown objects. Since many objects are cylindrical or box-like, or at least have such parts, we present a method to locate the best parameters for all such shapes in a cluttered scene. Our generic approach does not get more complex as the number of possible objects increases, and is still able to provide robust results and models that are relevant for grasp planning. We compared our approach to earlier methods and evaluated it on several cluttered tabletop scenes captured by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. © 7th German Conference on Robotics, ROBOTIK 2012},

abstract={In the context of robotic assistants in human everyday environments, pick and place tasks are beginning to be competently solved at the technical level. The question of where to place objects or where to pick them up from, among other higher-level reasoning tasks, is therefore gaining practical relevance. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying the organizational structure within an environment, i.e. the problem of determining organizational principles that would allow a robot to infer where to best place a particular, previously unseen object or where to reasonably search for a particular type of object given past observations about the allocation of objects to locations in the environment. This problem can be reasonably formulated as a classification task. We claim that organizational principles are governed by the notion of similarity and provide an empirical analysis of the importance of various features in datasets describing the organizational structure of kitchens. For the aforementioned classification tasks, we compare standard classification methods, reaching average accuracies of at least 79% in all scenarios. We thereby show that, in particular, ontology-based similarity measures are well-suited as highly discriminative features. We demonstrate the use of learned models of organizational principles in a kitchen environment on a real robot system, where the robot identifies a newly acquired item, determines a suitable location and then stores the item accordingly. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose the concept of Action-Related Place (ARPlace) as a powerful and exible representation of task-related place in the context of mobile manipulation. ARPlace represents robot base locations not as a single position, but rather as a collection of positions, each with an associated probability that the manipulation action will succeed when located there. ARPlaces are generated using a predictive model that is acquired through experience-based learning, and take into account the uncertainty the robot has about its own location and the location of the object to be manipulated. When executing the task, rather than choosing one specic goal position based only on the initial knowledge about the task context, the robot instantiates an ARPlace, and bases its decisions on this ARPlace, which is updated as new information about the task becomes available. To show the advantages of this least-commitment approach, we present a transformational planner that reasons about ARPlaces in order to optimize symbolic plans. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that using ARPlaces leads to more robust and ecient mobile manipulation in the face of state estimation uncertainty on our simulated robot. © 2012 AI Access Foundation.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a generalized framework for robustly operating previously unknown cabinets in kitchen environments. Our framework consists of the following four components: (1) a module for detecting both Lambertian and non-Lambertian (i.e. specular) handles, (2) a module for opening and closing novel cabinets using impedance control and for learning their kinematic models, (3) a module for storing and retrieving information about these objects in the map, and (4) a module for reliably operating cabinets of which the kinematic model is known. The presented work is the result of a collaboration of three PR2 beta sites. We rigorously evaluated our approach on 29 cabinets in five real kitchens located at our institutions. These kitchens contained 13 drawers, 12 doors, 2 refrigerators and 2 dishwashers. We evaluated the overall performance of detecting the handle of a novel cabinet, operating it and storing its model in a semantic map. We found that our approach was successful in 51.9% of all 104 trials. With this work, we contribute a well-tested building block of open-source software for future robotic service applications. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel lossy compression approach for point cloud streams which exploits spatial and temporal redundancy within the point data. Our proposed compression framework can handle general point cloud streams of arbitrary and varying size, point order and point density. Furthermore, it allows for controlling coding complexity and coding precision. To compress the point clouds, we perform a spatial decomposition based on octree data structures. Additionally, we present a technique for comparing the octree data structures of consecutive point clouds. By encoding their structural differences, we can successively extend the point clouds at the decoder. In this way, we are able to detect and remove temporal redundancy from the point cloud data stream. Our experimental results show a strong compression performance of a ratio of 14 at 1 mm coordinate precision and up to 40 at a coordinate precision of 9 mm. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Many of today's mobile robots are supposed to perform everyday manipulation tasks autonomously. However, in large-scale environments, a task-related object might be out of the robot's reach. Hence, the robot first has to search for the object in its environment before it can perform the task. In this paper, we present a decision-theoretic approach for searching objects in large-scale environments using probabilistic environment models and utilities associated with object locations. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by integrating it into a robot system and by conducting experiments where the robot is supposed to search different objects with various strategies in the context of fetch-and-delivery tasks within a multi-level building. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This article gives an overview of cognition-enabled robot control, a computational model for controlling autonomous service robots to achieve home chore task intelligence. For the realization of task intelligence, this computational model puts forth three core principles, which essentially involve the combination of reactive behavior specifications represented as semantically interpretable plans with inference mechanisms that enable flexible decision making. The representation of behavior specifications as plans enables the robot to not only execute the behavior specifications but also to reason about them and alter them during execution. We provide a description of a complete system for cognition-enabled robot control that implements the three core principles, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Robots that are to perform their tasks reliably and skillfully in complex domains such as a human household need to apply both, qualitative and quantitative reasoning to achieve their goals. Consider a robot whose task is to make pancakes, and part of the plan is to put down the bottle with pancake mix after pouring it on the pan. The put-down location of the bottle is heavily under-specified but has a critical influence on the overall performance of the plan. For instance, when it places it at a location where it occludes other objects, the robot cannot see and grasp the occluded objects anymore unless the bottle is removed again. Other important aspects include stability and reachability. Objects should not flip over or fall. A badly chosen put-down location can "block" trajectories for grasping other objects that were valid before and can even prevent the robot from reaching these objects. In this paper, we show a lightweight and fast reasoning system that integrates qualitative and quantitative reasoning based on Prolog. We demonstrate how we implement predicates that make use of OpenGL, the Bullet physics engine and inverse kinematics calculation. Equipped with generative models yielding pose candidates, our system allows for the generation of action parameters such as put down locations under the constraints of the current and future actions in real time. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In everyday object manipulation tasks, like making a pancake, autonomous robots are required to decide on the appropriate action parametrizations in order to achieve desired (and to avoid undesired) outcomes. For determining the right parameters for actions like pouring a pancake mix onto a pancake maker, robots need capabilities to predict the physical consequences of their own manipulation actions. In this work, we integrate a simulation-based approach for making temporal projections for robot manipulation actions into the logic programming language PROLOG. The realized system enables robots to determine action parameters that bring about certain effects by utilizing simulation-based temporal projections within PROLOG's chronological backtracking mechanism. For a set of formal parameters and their respective ranges of values, the developed system translates the manipulation problems into physical simulations, monitors and logs the relevant data structures of the simulations, translates the logged data back into first-order time-interval-based representations, called timelines, and eventually evaluates the individual timelines with respect to specified performance criteria. Integrating the proposed approach into robot control programs allow robots to mentally simulate the consequences of different action parametrizations before committing to them and thereby to reduce the number of undesired outcomes. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we report about our efforts to equip service robots with the capability to acquire 3D semantic maps. The robot autonomously explores indoor environments through the calculation of next best view poses, from which it assembles point clouds containing spatial and registered visual information. We apply various segmentation methods in order to generate initial hypotheses for furniture drawers and doors. The acquisition of the final semantic map makes use of the robot's proprioceptive capabilities and is carried out through the robot's interaction with the environment. We evaluated the proposed integrated approach in the real kitchen in our laboratory by measuring the quality of the generated map in terms of the map's applicability for the task at hand (e.g. resolving counter candidates by our knowledge processing system). © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a system for learning models of human reaching trajectories in the context of everyday manipulation activities. Different kinds of trajectories are automatically discovered, and each of them is described by its semantic context. In a first step, the system clusters trajectories in observations of human everyday activities based on their shapes, and then learns the relation between these trajectories and the contexts in which they are used. The resulting models can be used for robots to select a trajectory to use in a given context. They can also serve as powerful prediction models for human motions to improve human-robot interaction. Experiments on the TUM kitchen data set show that the method is capable of discovering meaningful clusters in real-world observations of everyday activities like setting a table. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct transparent objects. This approach makes use of the fact that many transparent objects, especially the ones consisting of usual glass, absorb light in certain wavelengths [1]. Given a controlled illumination, this absorption is measurable in the intensity response by comparison to the background. We show the usage of a standard infrared emitter and the intensity sensor of a time of flight (ToF) camera to reconstruct the structure given we have a second view point. The structure can not be measured by the usual 3D measurements of the ToF camera. We take advantage of this fact by deriving this internal sensory contradiction from two ToF images and reconstruct an approximated surface of the original transparent object. Therefor we are using a perspectively invariant matching in the intensity channels from the first to the second view of initially acquired candidates. For each matched pixel in the first view a 3D movement can be predicted given their original 3D measurement and the known distance to the second camera position. If their line of sight did not pass a transparent object or suffered any other major defect, this prediction will highly correspond to the actual measured 3D points of the second view. Otherwise, if a detectable error occurs, we approximate a more exact point to point matching and reconstruct the original shape by triangulating the points in the stereo setup. We tested our approach using a mobile platform with one Swissranger SR4k. As this platform is mobile, we were able to create a stereo setup by moving it. Our results show a detection of transparent objects on tables while simultaneously identifying opaque objects that also existed in the test setup. The viability of our results is demonstrated by a successful automated manipulation of the respective transparent object. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a semantic gap between simple but high-level action instructions like "Pick up the cup with the right hand" and low-level robot descriptions that model, for example, the structure and kinematics of a robot's manipulator. Currently, programmers bridge this gap by mapping abstract instructions to parametrized algorithms and rigid body parts of a robot within their control programs. By linking descriptions of robot components, i.e. sensors, actuators and control programs, via capabilities to actions in an ontology we equip robots with knowledge about themselves that allows them to infer the required components for performing a given action. Thereby a robot that is instructed by an end-user, a programmer, or even another robot to perform a certain action, can assess itself whether it is able and how to perform the requested action. This self-knowledge for robots could considerably change the way of robot control, robot interaction, robot programming, and multi-robot communication. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we propose a method to extract visual features from a tool in the hand of a robot to derive basic properties how to handle this tool correctly. We want to show how a robot can improve its accuracy in certain tasks by a visual exploration of geometric features. We also show methods to extend the proprioception of the robots arm to the new end-effector including the tool. By a combination of 3D and 2D data, it is possible to extract features like geometric edges, flat surfaces and concavities. From those features we can distinguish several classes of objects and make basic measurements of potential contact areas and other properties relevant for performing tasks. We also present a controller that uses the relative position or orientation of such features as constraints for manipulation tasks in the world. Such a controller allows to easily model complex tasks like pancake flipping or sausage fishing. The extension of the proprioception is achieved by a generalized filter setup for a set of force torque sensors, that allows the detection of indirect contacts performed over a tool and extract basic information like the approximated direction from the sensor data. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to produce robots that are more capable of skilled manipulation tasks, they must learn meaningful knowledge of how objects behave to external stimulus. With this knowledge a robot can predict the outcome of an action, control the object to serve a particular purpose, and together with reasoning, create or modify robot plans. In this paper we 1) build a mathematical compact model for planar sliding motion of an object, 2) show how a robot acquires the parameters of such a model; then how this is used to 3) predict pushing actions; and 4) to move an object from any position and orientation to another. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates an extended and optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art local curve fitting algorithm named Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm, originally developed by Hanek et al. In particular, we investigate its application in the field of personal robotics for the tasks such as the mobile manipulation which requires a segmentation of objects in clutter and the tracking of them. The developed system mainly consists of the two functional parts, the CCD algorithm to fit the model curve in still images and the CCD tracker to track the model in the videos. We demonstrate algorithm's working in various scenes using handheld camera and the cameras from the Personal Robot 2 (PR2). Achieved results show that the CCD algorithm achieves robustness and sub-pixel accuracy even in the presence of clutter, partial occlusion, and changes of illumination. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={We present an end-to-end framework which equips robots with the capability to perform reaching motions in a natural human-like fashion. A markerless, high-accuracy, model-based human motion tracker is used to observe how humans perform everyday activities in real-world scenarios. The obtained trajectories are clustered to represent different types of manipulation and reaching motions occurring in a kitchen environment. Using bilevel optimization methods a combination of physically inspired optimization principles is determined that describes the human motions best. For humanoid robots like the iCub these principles are used to compute reaching motion trajectories which are similar to human behavior and respect the individual requirements of the robotic hardware. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we report on a recent public experiment that shows two robots making pancakes using web instructions. In the experiment, the robots retrieve instructions for making pancakes from the World Wide Web and generate robot action plans from the instructions. This task is jointly performed by two autonomous robots: The first robot opens and closes cupboards and drawers, takes a pancake mix from the refrigerator, and hands it to the robot B. The second robot cooks and flips the pancakes, and then delivers them back to the first robot. While the robot plans in the scenario are all percept-guided, they are also limited in different ways and rely on manually implemented sub-plans for parts of the task. We will thus discuss the potential of the underlying technologies as well as the research challenges raised by the experiment. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={With Bayesian logic networks (BLNs), we present a practical representation formalism for statistical relational knowledge. Based on the concept of mixed networks with probabilistic and deterministic constraints, BLNs combine the probabilistic semantics of (relational) Bayesian networks with constraints in first-order logic. In practical applications, efficient inference in statistical relational models such as BLNs is a key concern. Motivated by the inherently mixed nature of models instantiated from BLNs, we investigate two novel importance sampling methods: The first combines backward simulation, i.e. sampling backward from the evidence, with systematic search, while the second explores the possibility of recording abstract constraints during the search for samples. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={While key for human-robot interaction, natural language interpretation is a notoriously difficult task, especially because the interaction context is at the same time essential for dialogue understanding, difficult to build for machines, and depends on each speaker point of view. However, robots as embodied artifacts, can perceive their environment and interactors, and hence compute symbolic models from various perspectives. This allows in turn to build symbolic contexts for dialogues. In this paper, we introduce DIALOGS, a component for natural language interpretation that relies on these structured symbolic models of the world to ground verbal interaction. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article we describe an object perception system for autonomous robots performing everyday manipulation tasks in kitchen environments. The perception system gains its strengths by exploiting that the robots are to perform the same kinds of tasks with the same objects over and over again. It does so by learning the object representations necessary for the recognition and reconstruction in the context of pick-and-place tasks. The system employs a library of specialized perception routines that solve different, well-defined perceptual sub-tasks and can be combined into composite perceptual activities including the construction of an object model database, multimodal object classification, and object model reconstruction for grasping. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, and give examples of application scenarios using our personal robotic assistants acting in a human living environment. © SAGE Publications 2011.},

abstract={Human faces are mostly seen in actions conveying various information in our daily life communication. On the other hand, human brains are capable of extracting this essential information in a very short interval of time resulting in a better interaction with others. For example, in interactive scenarios where human beings are assisted by intelligent systems or robots, it is quite useful to extract sufficient information about the interacting person. In this paper we study biometric and soft-biometric traits of the humans by using their face information using a single feature set which is representative of person's identity, gender and facial behavior. This problem is addressed using spatio-temporal multifeatures (STMF) extracted from image sequences using a 3D face model. Further, this feature set provides robustness against varying head poses and facial expressions. Experiments have been performed on laboratory captured images and three benchmark databases under varying poses and facial expressions. The results have been discussed comparatively with different approaches. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports empirical findings on human performance in an experiment comprising a perceptual task and a motor task. Such findings should be considered in design of robots, since drawing inspiration from natural solutions not only should prove beneficial for artificial systems but also human-robot interaction should then become more efficient and safe. Humans have developed various mechanisms to optimize the way actions are performed and the effects they induce. Optimization of action planning (e.g., grasping, reaching or lifting objects) requires efficient selection of action-relevant features. Selection might also depend on the environmental context in which an action takes place. The present study investigated how action context influences perceptual processing in action planning. The experimental paradigm comprised two independent tasks: (1) a perceptual visual search task and (2) a grasping or a pointing movement. Reaction times in the visual search task were measured as a function of the movement type (grasping vs. pointing) and context complexity (context varying along one dimension vs. context varying along two dimensions). Results showed that action context influenced reaction times, which suggests a close bidirectional link between action and perception as well as an impact of environmental action context on perceptual selection in the course of action planning. These findings are discussed in the context of application for robotics and design of users' interfaces. © Springer Science & Business Media BV 2010.},

abstract={The autonomous robotics community is starting to tackle more complex manipulation activities, such as doing household chores, in more realistic operating environments such as human working and living environments. One of the biggest challenges in such applications is the open endedness of the task domains and the enormous amount of knowledge needed to achieve success for the reliable task. Luckily, almost every robot has access to the World Wide Web (WWW), the world's largest knowledge and information source. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={As robots are starting to perform everyday manipulation tasks, such as cleaning up, setting a table, or preparing simple meals, their control programs must become much more knowledgeable than they are today. Typically, everyday manipulation tasks are vaguely specified, and the robot must therefore infer by itself how to do the appropriate actions on objects in an appropriate manner to accomplish these tasks. These inferences can only be done if the robot has access to the necessary knowledge, including knowledge about how the objects look, what their properties are, where they can be found, and what might happen if particular actions are performed on them. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Humans can use the Internet to share knowledge and to help each other accomplish complex tasks. Until now, robots have not taken advantage of this opportunity. Sharing knowledge between robots requires methods to effectively encode, exchange, and reuse data. In this article, we present the design and first implementation of a system for sharing knowledge between robots. In the manufacturing and logistics industries, robotic systems have brought significant sociological and economic benefits through improved human safety, increased equipment utilization, reduced maintenance costs, and increased production. In a world that is undergoing significant environmental and social change, there will be an increasing demand for these robots to leave the safety of their controlled environments and operate in the real world. Robots will be required to operate in homes and hospitals to service the health of a rapidly aging population, and they will be required to mine and farm in increasingly remote locations. In these environments, robots will need to reliably performtasks beyond their explicitly preprogrammed behaviors and quickly adapt to the unstructured and variable nature of tasks. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Performing everyday manipulation tasks successfully depends on the ability of autonomous robots to appropriately account for the physical behavior of task-related objects. Meaning that robots have to predict and consider the physical effects of their possible actions to take. In this work we investigate a simulation-based approach to naive physics temporal projection in the context of autonomous robot everyday manipulation. We identify the abstractions underlying typi-cal first-order axiomatizations as the key obstacles for making valid naive physics predictions. We propose that temporal projection for naive physics problems should not be performed based on abstractions but rather based on detailed physical simulations. This idea is realized as a temporal projection system for autonomous manipulation robots that translates naive physics problems into parametrized physical simulation tasks, that logs the data structures and states traversed in simulation, and translates the logged data back into symbolic time-interval-based first-order representations. Within this paper, we describe the concept and implementation of the temporal projection system and present the example of an egg-cracking robot for demonstrating its feasibility.

abstract={Today's manufacturing and assembly systems have to be flexible to adapt quickly to an increasing number and variety of products, and changing market volumes. To manage these dynamics, several production concepts (e.g., flexible, reconfigurable, changeable or autonomous manufacturing and assembly systems) were proposed and partly realized in the past years. This paper presents the general principles of autonomy and the proposed concepts, methods and technologies to realize cognitive planning, cognitive control and cognitive operation of production systems. Starting with an introduction on the historical context of different paradigms of production (e.g., evolution of production and planning systems), different approaches for the design, planning, and operation of production systems are lined out and future trends towards fully autonomous components of an production system as well as autonomous parts and products are discussed. In flexible production systems with manual and automatic assembly tasks, human-robot cooperation is an opportunity for an ergonomic and economic manufacturing system especially for low lot sizes. The state-of-the-art and a cognitive approach in this area are outlined. Furthermore, introducing self-optimizing and self-learning control systems is a crucial factor for cognitive systems. This principles are demonstrated by a quality assurance and process control in laser welding that is used to perform improved quality monitoring. Finally, as the integration of human workers into the workflow of a production system is of the highest priority for an efficient production, worker guidance systems for manual assembly with environmentally- and situationally dependent triggered paths on state-based graphs are described in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel efficient algorithm for robust tracking of a fixed number of targets in real-time with low failure rate. The method is an instance of Sequential Importance Resampling filters approximating the posterior of complete target configurations as a mixture of Gaussians. Using predicted target positions by Kalman filters, data associations are sampled for each measurement sweep according to their likelihood allowing to constrain the number of associations per target. Updated target configurations are weighted for resampling pursuant to their explanatory power for former positions and measurements. Fixed-lag of the resulting positions increases the tracking quality while smart resampling and memoization decrease the computational demand. We present both, qualitative and quantitative experimental results on two demanding real-world applications with occluded and highly confusable targets, demonstrating the robustness and real-time performance of our approach outperforming current state-of-the-art. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the influence of uncertainties on large-scale industrial radial compressors. The goal is to verify the robustness of new compressor designs towards operational and geometrical uncertainties. Key uncertainties for compressors are identified. Detailed measurements are conducted and modeled by probability distributions. These models then serve as input for the uncertainty analysis. For the uncertainty analysis different techniques are compared. The focus is on computationally efficient techniques, i.e., the required number of CFD simulations for the uncertainty analysis should be minimal. Promising methods are the Probabilistic Collocation Method and techniques that use response surface models in combination with the i-optimal design approach for generating sample points. Pure Monte Carlo simulations are not practical as they are too time-consuming. The key uncertainty considered here is the surface roughness. The effect is modeled with a commercial CFD RANS solver. The uncertainty analyzes show a performance decrease and variation for roughness values above the limit of hydraulically smooth surfaces. © 2010 by ASME.},

abstract={This paper describes CRAM (Cognitive Robot Abstract Machine) as a software toolbox for the design, the implementation, and the deployment of cognition-enabled autonomous robots performing everyday manipulation activities. CRAM equips autonomous robots with lightweight reasoning mechanisms that can infer control decisions rather than requiring the decisions to be preprogrammed. This way CRAM-programmed autonomous robots are much more flexible, reliable, and general than control programs that lack such cognitive capabilities. CRAM does not require the whole domain to be stated explicitly in an abstract knowledge base. Rather, it grounds symbolic expressions in the knowledge representation into the perception and actuation routines and into the essential data structures of the control programs. In the accompanying video, we show complex mobile manipulation tasks performed by our household robot that were realized using the CRAM infrastructure. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Robots that know what they are doing can solve their tasks more reliably, flexibly, and efficiently. They can even explain what they were doing, how and why. In this paper we describe a system that not only is capable of executing flexible and reliable plans on a robotic platform but can also explain control decisions and the reason for specific actions, diagnose the cause of failures and answer queries about the robot's beliefs. For instance, when queried why it opened the cupboard door, the robot might answer that it did so because it believed Michael's cup to be in there. This type of reasoning is not only helpful for debugging but also provides the mechanisms for complex monitoring and failure handling that is not based on local failures and exception handling but on the expressive formulation of error patterns in first order logics. Our system is based on semantic annotations of plans, a fast logging mechanism and the computation of predicates in a first-order representation based on the execution trace. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={When a robot wants to manipulate an object, it needs to know what action to execute to obtain the desired result. In most of the cases, the actions that can be applied to an object consist of exerting forces to it. If a robot is able to predict what will happen to an object when some force is applied to it, then it's possible to build a controller that solves the inverse problem of what force needs to be applied in order to get a desired result. To accomplish this, the first task is to build an object model and second to get the right parameters for it. The goals of this paper are 1) to demonstrate the use of an object model to predict outcomes of actions, and 2) to adapt this model to an specific object instance for a specific robot. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Robotic grasping in an open environment requires both object-specific as well as general grasping skills. When the objects are previously known it is possible to employ techniques that exploit object models, like geometrical grasping simulators. On the other hand, a competent system will also be able to deal with unmodeled objects using general solutions. In this paper we present an integrated system for autonomous rigid-object pick-up tasks in domestic environments, focusing on the gripping of unmodeled objects and exploiting sensor feedback from the robot hand to monitor the grasp. We describe the perception system based on time-of-flight range data, the grasp pose optimization algorithm and the grasp execution.

abstract={In this chapter, we focus on the human robot joint interaction application where robots can extract the useful multiple features from human faces. The idea follows daily life scenarios where humans rely mostly on face to face interaction and interpret gender, identity, facial behavior and age of the other persons at a very first glance. We term this problem as face-at-a-glance problem. The proposed solution to this problem is the development of a 3D photorealistic face model in real time for human facial analysis. We also discuss briefly some outstanding challenges like head poses, facial expressions and illuminations for image synthesis. Due to the diversity of the application domain and optimization of relevant information extraction for computer vision applications, we propose to solve this problem using an interdisciplinary 3D face model. The model is built using computer vision and computer graphics tools with image processing techniques. In order to trade off between accuracy and efficiency, we choose wireframe model which provides automatic face generation in real time. The goal of this chapter is to provide a standalone and comprehensive framework to extract useful multi-feature from a 3D model. Such features due to their wide range of information and less computational power, finds their applications in several advanced camera mounted technical systems. Although this chapter focuses on multi-feature extraction approach for human faces in interactive applications with intelligent systems, however the scope of this chapter is equally useful for researchers and industrial practitioner working in the modeling of 3D deformable. © 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract={Most grasping systems require complete CAD models as input, but building these models automatically is not straightforward. We propose a strategy for approximating complete models of previously unknown objects from a single 3D scan of a cluttered scene. We achieve this by exploiting common symmetries in objects of daily use, and by handling over- and under-segmentation issues. The idea is to use 3D shape primitives by breaking up objects into parts than can be approximated by boxes and cylinders. To validate the reconstruction, we present a set of experimental results using real-world data-sets containing a large number of objects from different scan-points.},

abstract={Autonomous household robots are supposed to accomplish complex tasks like cleaning the dishes which involve both navigation and manipulation within the environment. For navigation, spatial information is mostly sufficient, but manipulation tasks raise the demand for deeper knowledge about objects, such as their types, their functions, or the way how they can be used. We present KNOWROB-MAP, a system for building environment models for robots by combining spatial information about objects in the environment with encyclopedic knowledge about the types and properties of objects, with common-sense knowledge describing what the objects can be used for, and with knowledge derived from observations of human activities by learning statistical relational models. In this paper, we describe the concept and implementation of KNOWROB-MAP and present several examples demonstrating the range of information the system can provide to autonomous robots. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Knowing precisely where objects are located enables a robot to perform its tasks both more efficiently and more reliably. To acquire the respective knowledge and to effectively use it as a resource, a robot has to go through the world with "open eyes". Specifically, it has to become environment-aware by keeping track of where objects of interest are located and explicitly represent their geometrical properties. In this paper, we propose to equip robots with a perception system that passively monitors the environment using a 3D data acquisition system, identifying objects that might become the subject of future manipulation tasks. Our system encompasses a 3D semantic mapping and reconstruction pipeline and a storage and data merging unit for perceived information that provides on-demand modeling and comparison capabilities. Based on probabilistic logical models, we address the important perceptual subtask of object identity resolution, i.e. inferring which observations refer to which entities in the real world (perceptual anchoring). Our system can be used as a bootstrapping system for the generation of object-centric knowledge and can, in this way, be used as a mid-level perception system that enables activity recognition, scene recognition and high-level planning. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes and discusses the K-COPMAN (Knowledge-enabled Cognitive Perception for Manipulation) system, which enables autonomous robots to generate symbolic representations of perceived objects and scenes and to infer answers to complex queries that require the combination of perception and knowledge processing. Using K-COPMAN, the robot can solve inference tasks such as identifying items that are likely to be missing on a breakfast table. To the programmer K-COPMAN, is presented as a logic programming system that can be queried just like a symbolic knowledge base. Internally, K-COPMAN is realized through a data structure framework together with a library of state-of-the-art perception mechanisms for mobile manipulation in human environments. Key features of K-COPMAN are that it can make a robot environment-aware and that it supports goal-directed as well as passive perceptual processing. K-COPMAN is fully integrated into an autonomous mobile manipulation robot and is realized within the open-source robot library ROS. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a comprehensive object categorization and classification system, of great importance for mobile manipulation applications in indoor environments. In detail, we tackle the problem of recognizing everyday objects that are useful for a personal robotic assistant in fulfilling its tasks, using a hierarchical multi-modal 3D-2D processing and classification system. The acquired 3D data is used to estimate geometric labels (plane, cylinder, edge, rim, sphere) at each voxel cell using the Radius-based Surface Descriptor (RSD). Then, we propose the use of a Global RSD feature (GRSD) to categorize point clusters that are geometrically identical into one of the object categories. Once a geometric category and a 3D position is obtained for each object cluster, we extract the region of interest in the camera image and compute a SURF-based feature vector for it. Thus we obtain the exact object instance and the orientation around the object's up-right axis from the appearance. The resultant system provides a hierarchical categorization of objects into basic classes from their geometry and identifies objects and their poses based on their appearance, with near real-time performance. We validate our approach on an extensive database of objects that we acquired using real sensing devices, and on both unseen views and unseen objects. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a method for building models for grasping from a single 3D snapshot of a scene composed of objects of daily use in human living environments. We employ fast shape estimation, probabilistic model fitting and verification methods capable of dealing with different kinds of symmetries, and combine these with a triangular mesh of the parts that have no other representation to model previously unseen objects of arbitrary shape. Our approach is enhanced by the information given by the geometric clues about different parts of objects which serve as prior information for the selection of the appropriate reconstruction method. While we designed our system for grasping based on single view 3D data, its generality allows us to also use the combination of multiple views. We present two application scenarios that require complete geometric models: grasp planning and locating objects in camera images. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an embeddable knowledge processing framework, along with a common-sense ontology, designed for robotics. We believe that a direct and explicit integration of cognition is a compulsory step to enable human-robots interaction in semantic-rich human environments like our houses. The OpenRobots Ontology (ORO) kernel allows to turn previously acquired symbols into concepts linked to each other. It enables in turn reasoning and the implementation of other advanced cognitive functions like events, categorization, memory management and reasoning on parallel cognitive models. We validate this framework on several cognitive scenarii that have been implemented on three different robotic architectures. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The key task in probabilistic reasoning is to appropriately update one's beliefs as one obtains new information in the form of evidence. In many application settings, however, the evidence we obtain as input to an inference problem may be uncertain (e.g. owing to unreliable mechanisms with which we obtain the evidence) or may correspond to (soft) degrees of belief rather than hard logical facts. So far, methods for updating beliefs in the light of soft evidence have been centred around the iterative proportional fitting procedure and variations thereof. In this work, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that allows to directly integrate soft evidence into the inference procedure without generating substantial computational overhead. Within the framework of Markov logic networks, we demonstrate the potential benefit of this method over standard approaches in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world applications. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Cognitive technical systems (CTS) are information processing systems equipped with artificial sensors and actuators, integrated and embedded into physical systems, and acting in a physical world. They differ from other technical systems as they perform cognitive control and have cognitive capabilities. Cognitive control orchestrates reflexive and habitual behavior in accord with longterm intentions. Cognitive capabilities such as perception, action, knowledge and models, reasoning, learning and planning turn technical systems into systems that “know what they are doing”. The cognitive capabilities result in systems of higher reliability, flexibility, adaptivity and better performance. © 2010, Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Tracking multiple targets with similar appearance is a common task in many computer vision applications as surveillance or sports analysis. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Resampling Particle Filter (RBRPF) as a real-time multi-target tracking method that solves the data association problem by a Monte Carlo approach. Each particle containing the whole target configuration is predicted by using a process model and resampled by sampling associations and fusing of the predicted state with the assigned measurement(s) instead of the common dispersion. As each target state is modeled as a Gaussian, Rao-Blackwellization can be used to solve some of these steps analytically. The sampling of associations splits the multi-target tracking problem in multiple single target tracking problems, which can be handled by Kalman filters in an optimal way. The method is independent of the order of measurements which is mostly predetermined by the measuring process in contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches. Smart resampling and memoization is introduced to equip the tracking method with real-time capabilities in the first place exploiting the discreteness of the associations. The probabilistic framework allows for consideration of appearance models and the fusion of different sensors. A way to constrain the multiplicity of measurements associated with a single target is proposed and - along with the ability to cope with a high number of targets in clutter - evaluated in a simulation experiment. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to real world applications by tracking soccer players captured by multiple cameras through occlusions in real-time. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article investigates fundamental issues in scaling autonomous personal robots towards open-ended sets of everyday manipulation tasks which involve high complexity and vague job specifications. To achieve this, we propose a control architecture that synergetically integrates some of the most promising artificial intelligence (AI) methods that we consider as necessary for the performance of everyday manipulation tasks in human living environments: deep representations, probabilistic first-order learning and reasoning, and transformational planning of reactive behavior all of which are integrated in a coherent high-level robot control system: Cogito. We demonstrate the strengths of this combination of methods by realizing, as a proof of concept, an autonomous personal robot capable of setting a table efficiently using instructions from the world wide web. To do so, the robot translates instructions into executable robot plans, debugs its plan to eliminate behavior flaws caused by missing pieces of information and ambiguities in the instructions, optimizes its plan by revising the course of activity, and infers the most likely job from vague job description using probabilistic reasoning. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Knowledge processing methods are an important resource for robots that perform challenging tasks in complex, dynamic environments. When applied to robot control, such methods allow to write more general and flexible control programs and enable reasoning about the robot’s observations, the actions involved in a task, action parameters and the reasons why an action was performed. However, the application of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to autonomous robots creates several hard research challenges. In this article, we discuss some of these challenges and our approaches to solving them. © 2010, Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={People perform daily activities in many different ways. When setting a table, they might use a tray, stack plates, stack cups on plates, leave the doors of a cupboard open when taking several items out of it. Similarly flexible behavior is desired when mobile robots perform household tasks. Moreover, they should perform actions in a way that they are accepted by the people, for example by showing human-like behavior. In this paper we propose to extend a transformational planning system with models characterizing the behavior produced by the different plans in the plan library. These models are used by the robot to select a plan that resembles human behavior. In addition to acting more human-like, this helps the robot choose good plans for a task by imitating humans instead of performing exhaustive search. We show the feasibility of this approach using a household robot application as an example and present empirical results on the classification accuracy in this domain. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Service robots will have to accomplish more and more complex, open-ended tasks and regularly acquire new skills. In this work, we propose a new approach to the problem of generating plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic actions - the common approach in robot planning - we propose to transform task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation, for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile robot's plan language RPL. We discuss the problem of inferring information that is missing in these descriptions and the problem of grounding the abstract task descriptions in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction. It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language directives, of which up to 80% could be correctly transformed. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose automated probabilistic models of everyday activities (AM-EvA) as a novel technical means for the perception, interpretation, and analysis of everyday manipulation tasks and activities of daily life. AM-EvAs are detailed, comprehensive models describing human actions at various levels of abstraction from raw poses and trajectories to motions, actions and activities. They integrate several kinds of action models in a common, knowledge-based framework to combine observations of human activities with a-priori knowledge about actions. AM-EvAs enable robots and technical systems to analyze actions in the complete situation and activity context. They make the classification and assessment of actions and situations objective and can justify the probabilistic interpretation with respect to the activities the concepts have been learned from. AM-EvAs allow to analyze and compare the way humans perform actions which can help with autonomy assessment and diagnosis. We describe in this paper the concept and implementation of the AM-EvA system and show example results from the observation and analysis of table-setting episodes. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Statistical relational models, such as Markov logic networks, seek to compactly describe properties of relational domains by representing general principles about objects belonging to particular classes. Models are intended to be independent of the set of objects to which these principles can be applied, and it is assumed that the principles will soundly generalize across arbitrary sets of objects. In this paper, we point out limitations of models that seek to represent the corresponding principles with a fixed set of parameters and discuss the conditions under which the soundness of fixed parameters is indeed questionable. We propose a novel representation formalism called adaptive Markov logic networks to allow more flexible representations of relational domains, which involve parameters that are dynamically adjusted to fit the properties of an instantiation by phrasing the model's parameters as functions over attributes of the instantiation at hand. We empirically demonstrate the value of our learning and representation system on a simple but well-motivated example domain. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article investigates methods for achieving more general manipulation capabilities for mobile manipulation platforms, which produce legible behavior in human living environments. To achieve generality and legibility, we combine two control mechanisms. First of all, experience- and observation-based learning of skills is applied to routine tasks, so that the repetitive and stereotypical character of everyday activity is exploited. Second, we use planning, reasoning, and search for novel tasks which have no stereotypical solution. We apply these ideas to the learning and use of action-related places, to the model-based visual recognition and localization of objects, and the learning and application of reaching strategies and motions from humans. We demonstrate the integration of these mechanisms into a single low-level control system for autonomous manipulation platforms. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Knowledge processing is an essential technique for enabling autonomous robots to do the right thing to the right object in the right way. Using knowledge processing the robots can achieve more flexible and general behavior and better performance. While knowledge representation and reasoning has been a well-established research field in Artificial Intelligence for several decades, little work has been done to design and realize knowledge processing mechanisms for the use in the context of robotic control. In this paper, we report on KNOWROB, a knowledge processing system particularly designed for autonomous personal robots. KNOWROB is a first-order knowledge representation based on description logics that provides specific mechanisms and tools for action-centered representation, for the automated acquisition of grounded concepts through observation and experience, for reasoning about and managing uncertainty, and for fast inference - knowledge processing features that are particularly necessary for autonomous robot control. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In mobile manipulation, the position to which the robot navigates has a large influence on the ease with which a subsequent manipulation action can be performed. Whether a manipulation action succeeds depends on many factors, such as the robot's hardware configuration, the controllers the robot uses to achieve navigation and manipulation, the task context, and uncertainties in state estimation. In this paper, we present 'ARPLACE', an action-related place which takes these factors, and the context in which the actions are performed into account. Through experience-based learning, the robot first learns a so-called generalized success model, which discerns between positions from which manipulation succeeds or fails. On-line, this model is used to compute a ARPLACE, a probability distribution that maps positions to a predicted probability of successful manipulation, and takes the uncertainty in the robot and object's position into account. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that using ARPLACEs for least-commitment navigation improves the success rate of subsequent manipulation tasks substantially. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a new approach for labeling 3D points with different geometric surface primitives using a novel feature descriptor - the Fast Point Feature Histograms, and discriminative graphical models. To build informative and robust 3D feature point representations, our descriptors encode the underlying surface geometry around a point p using multi-value histograms. This highly dimensional feature space copes well with noisy sensor data and is not dependent on pose or sampling density. By defining classes of 3D geometric surfaces and making use of contextual information using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), our system is able to successfully segment and label 3D point clouds, based on the type of surfaces the points are lying on. We validate and demonstrate the method's efficiency by comparing it against similar initiatives as well as present results for table setting datasets acquired in indoor environments. © 2009 IEEE.},

Our proposed approach proposes a robust geometric mapping pipeline for large input datasets that extracts relevant objects useful for a personal robotic assistant to perform manipulation tasks. The objects are segmented out from partial views and a reconstructed model is computed by fitting geometric primitive classes such as planes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of 3D object categorization of objects typically present in kitchen environments, from data acquired using a composite sensor. Our framework combines different sensing modalities and defines descriptive features in various spaces for the purpose of learning good object models. By fusing the 3D information acquired from a composite sensor that includes a color stereo camera, a time-of-flight (TOF) camera, and a thermal camera, we augment 3D depth data with color and temperature information which helps disambiguate the object categorization process. We make use of statistical relational learning methods (Markov Logic Networks and Bayesian Logic Networks) to capture complex interactions between the different feature spaces. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze and validate the proposed system for the problem of recognizing objects in table settings scenarios. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Planning means deciding on the future course of action based on predictions of what will happen when an activity is carried out in one way or the other. As we apply action planning to autonomous, sensor-guided mobile robots with manipulators or even to humanoid robots we need very realistic and detailed predictions of the behavior generated by a plan in order to improve the robot's performance substantially. In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection of realistic robot behavior based on physics-and sensor-based simulation systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means to log simulated plan executions into a database. A logic-based query and inference mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the necessary information from the database and translates the information into a first-order representation of robot plans and the behavior they generate. The query language enables the robot planning system to infer the intentions, the beliefs, and the world state at any projected time. It also allows the planning system to recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan failures typical for performing everyday manipulation tasks.

abstract={We present a markerless tracking system for unconstrained human motions which are typical for everyday manipulation tasks. Our system is capable of tracking a highdimensional human model (51 DOF) without constricting the type of motion and the need for training sequences. The system reliably tracks humans that frequently interact with the environment, that manipulate objects, and that can be partially occluded by the environment. We describe and discuss two key components that substantially contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the system. First, a sophisticated hierarchical sampling strategy for recursive Bayesian estimation that combines partitioning with annealing strategies to enable efficient search in the presence of many local maxima. Second, a simple yet effective appearance model that allows for the combination of shape and appearance masks to implicitly deal with two cases of environmental occlusions by (1) subtracting dynamic non-human objects from the region of interest and (2) modeling objects (e.g. tables) that both occlude and can be occluded by human subjects. The appearance model is based on bit representations that makes our algorithm well suited for implementation on highly parallel hardware such as commodity GPUs. Extensive evaluations on the HumanEva2 benchmarks show the potential of our method when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian techniques. Besides the HumanEva2 benchmarks, we present results on more challenging sequences, including table setting tasks in a kitchen environment and persons getting into and out of a car mock-up. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of our project is to develop a robot to manipulate an object in human environment. In this paper, as a first step, we focus on opening paper box such as tea box, and present a method to plan grasp motion by 2 arms with multi-fingered hands. we propose a task priority based scheme to plan grasping area consistent with whole steps of the given task procedure. Based on the grasping area and the concept of preshape, we derive desired fingertip positions and hand base position and orientation for preshape. Based on the vector field approach, we propose a motion planning method for the planned grasp by multi-fingered hands to avoid any undesired collisions. This method can be applied to regrasping and a motion in which collision is required.},

abstract={We introduce the publicly available TUM Kitchen Data Set as a comprehensive collection of activity sequences recorded in a kitchen environment equipped with multiple complementary sensors. The recorded data consists of observations of naturally performed manipulation tasks as encountered in everyday activities of human life. Several instances of a table-setting task were performed by different subjects, involving the manipulation of objects and the environment. We provide the original video sequences, fullbody motion capture data recorded by a markerless motion tracker, RFID tag readings and magnetic sensor readings from objects and the environment, as well as corresponding action labels. In this paper, we both describe how the data was computed, in particular the motion tracker and the labeling, and give examples what it can be used for. We present .rst results of an automatic method for segmenting the observed motions into semantic classes, and describe how the data can be integrated in a knowledge-based framework for reasoning about the observations. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a geometric reasoning method for dealing with noise as well as faults present in 3D depth maps. These maps are acquired using stereo-vision sensors, but our framework makes no assumption about the origin of the underlying data. The method is based on observations made on the environment from different camera poses (viewpoints), where the occupied space as well as uncertainties in the range measurement are modelled using dynamic octree structures. This scheme allows us to detect and diagnose faulty range measurements in an efficient manner. We present results on the acquisition of comprehensive 3D maps for an agricultural robot operating in an orchard. © 2009 IFAC.},

abstract={Humans have developed various mechanisms to optimize interaction with the environment. Optimization of action planning requires efficient selection of action-relevant features. Selection might also depend on the environmental context in which an action takes place. The present study investigated how action context influences perceptual processing in action planning. The experimental paradigm comprised two independent tasks: (1) a perceptual visual search task and (2) a grasping or a pointing movement. Reaction times in the visual search task were measured as a function of the movement type (grasping vs. pointing) and context complexity (context varying along one dimension vs. context varying along two dimensions). Results showed that action context influenced reaction times, which suggests a close bidirectional link between action and perception as well as an impact of environmental action context on perceptual selection in the course of action planning. Such findings are discussed in the context of application for robotics. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel 3D scene interpretation approach for robots in mobile manipulation scenarios using a set of 3D point features (Fast Point Feature Histograms) and probabilistic graphical methods (Conditional Random Fields). Our system uses real time stereo with textured light to obtain dense depth maps in the robot's manipulators working space. For the purposes of manipulation, we want to interpret the planar supporting surfaces of the scene, recognize and segment the object classes into their primitive parts in 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) so that the robot knows what it is attempting to use and where it may be handled. The scene interpretation algorithm uses a two-layer classification scheme: i) we estimate Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) as local 3D point features to segment the objects of interest into geometric primitives; and ii) we learn and categorize object classes using a novel Global Fast Point Feature Histogram (GFPFH) scheme which uses the previously estimated primitives at each point. To show the validity of our approach, we analyze the proposed system for the problem of recognizing the object class of 20 objects in 500 table settings scenarios. Our algorithm identifies the planar surfaces, decomposes the scene and objects into geometric primitives with 98.27% accuracy and uses the geometric primitives to identify the object's class with an accuracy of 96.69%. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes face recognition across facial expressions variations. We focus on an automatic feature extraction technique which is not only efficient but also accurate for person identification. A 3D wireframe model is fitted to face images using a robust objective function. Furthermore, we extract structural and textural information which is coupled with temoral information from the motion of local facial features. The extracted information is combined to form a feature vector descriptor for each image. This set of features has been tested on two databases for face recognition across facial expressions. We use Bayesian Network (BN) and Binary Decision Trees (BDT) as classifiers. The developed system is automatic, real-time capable and efficient. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The present study investigated the influence of obstacles that differed in size on a pick-and-place movement. The aim was to investigate movement constraints imposed by obstacle avoidance. The experimental results confirmed that different obstacles affected movement kinematics of the pick-and-place movement as did the direction in which the movement had to be performed. Temporal movement parameters such as movement time and mean velocity showed modulations as well. These results implied that information on obstacle size and movement direction was integrated in the planning and execution phase of the pick-and-place movement. Results and their implication on robot control are also discussed. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Humanoid robots performing every day tasks in human environments need a strong perception system in order to operate successfully. As 3D data acquisition devices like laser scanners and time of flight cameras get better and cheaper, we expect three-dimensional perception to becomemore important. We describe a new method for detecting surfaces of revolution in point clouds within our Sample Consensus Framework. Cylinders, cones and arbitrary rotational surfaces can be reliably and efficiently detected. Symmetry assumptions can be hypothesized and verified in order to complete the model from a single view, i.e, to generate data on the occluded parts of the object. These complete models can be used for grasp analysis. Additionally, we propose a new method for scoring models within the Sample Consensus Framework in order to get better shapes. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Humanoid robotic assistants need capable and comprehensive perception systems that enable them to perform complex manipulation and grasping tasks. This requires the identification and recognition of supporting planes and objects in the world, together with their precise 6D poses. In this paper, we propose a 3D perception system architecture that can robustly fit CAD models in cluttered table setting scenes for the purpose of grasping with a mobile manipulator. Our approach uses a powerful combination of two different camera technologies, Time-Of-Flight (TOF) and RGB, to robustly segment the scene and extract object clusters. Using an a-priori database of object models we then perform a CAD matching in 2D camera images. We validate the proposed system in a number of experiments, and compare the system's performance and reliability with similar initiatives. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates integration of the supervised machine learning algorithms (Model Trees, Neural Networks) into a production plan realized in a physics-based realistic simulator. Proposed novelty is in that the learning capability is integrated into the control process which allows for online learning and on the fly control code modification. Running the process in a simulated environment enables hazardless experimenting with the system's setup and integral acquisition of data. Yielded optimization times obtained through learning outperform times of a production process solely based on averaging. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a feature extraction technique from human face image sequences using model based approach. We study two different models with our proposed approach towards multifeature extraction. These features are efficiently used for human face information extraction for different applications. The approach follows in fitting a model to face image using robust objective function and extracting textural and temporal features for three major applications naming 1) face recognition, 2) facial expressions recognition and 3) gender classification. For experimentation and comparative study of our multi-features over two models, we use same set of features with two different classifiers generating promising results to explain that extracted features are strong enough to be used for face image analysis. Features goodness has been investigated on Cohn Kanade Facial Expressions Database (CKFED). The proposed multi-features approach is automatic and real time. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={In most activities of daily living, related tasks are encountered over and over again. This regularity allows humans and robots to reuse existing solutions for known recurring tasks. We expect that reusing a set of standard solutions to solve similar tasks will facilitate the design and on-line adaptation of the control systems of robots operating in human environments. In this paper, we derive a set of standard solutions for reaching behavior from human motion data. We also derive stereotypical reaching trajectories for variations of the task, in which obstacles are present. These stereotypical trajectories are then compactly represented with Dynamic Movement Primitives. On the humanoid robot Sarcos CB, this approach leads to reproducible, predictable, and human-like reaching motions. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a comprehensive perception system with applications to mobile manipulation and grasping for personal robotics. Our approach makes usc of dense 3D point cloud data acquired using stereo vision cameras by projecting textured light onto the scene. To create models suitable for grasping, we extract the supporting planes and model object clusters with different surface geometric primitives. The resultant decoupled primitive point clusters are then reconstructed as smooth triangular mesh surfaces, and their use is validated in grasping experiments using OpenRAVE [1]. To annotate the point cloud data with primitive geometric labels we make use of our previously proposed Fast Point Feature Histograms [2] and probabilistic graphical methods (Conditional Random Fields), and obtain a classification accuracy of 98.27% for different object geometries. We show the validity of our approach by analyzing the proposed system for the problem of building object models usable in grasping applications with the PR2 robot (sec Figure 1). ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Current approaches for factory automation have not yet fully succeeded in realizing an autonomous manufacturing system for mass customized, highly variant products. In this interdisciplinary work between computer science and mechanical engineering departments, the authors report on an integral approach for a cognitive manufacturing system which uses planning, perception and knowledge capabilities to reach a level of flexibility and robustness as found in a traditional human workshop. Integrating a bottom-up approach for local machining planning, a global planning system and a perception system, an autonomously operating manufacturing system can be realized. The integrated approach is validated using a simple yet characteristic example part that demonstrates the potential of the approach and the interplay and interfaces between the methods. Overall, the approach demonstrates that a specialized local planning system for machining can be effectively integrated with a general, global planning system and a perception system and thus be integrated in the manufacturing system. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Analytic modeling, imitation, and experience-based learning are three approaches that enable robots to acquire models of their morphology and skills. In this paper, we combine these three approaches to efficiently gather training data to learn a model of reachability for a typical mobile manipulation task: approaching a worksurface in order to grasp an object. The core of the approach is experience-based learning. For more effective exploration, we use capability maps [20] as analytic models of the robot's dexterity to constrain the area in which the robot gathers training data. Furthermore, we acquire a human model of reachability from human motion data [17] and use it to bias exploration. The acquired training data is used to learn Action-Related Places [16]. In an empirical evaluation we demonstrate that combining the three approaches enables the robot to acquire accurate models with far less data than with our previous exploration strategy. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes an image segmentation and normalization technique using 3D point distribution model and its counterpart in 2D space. This segmentation is efficient to work for holistic image recognition algorithm. The results have been tested with face recognition application using Cohn Kanade Facial Expressions Database (CKFED). The approach follows by fitting a model to face image and registering it to a standard template. The models consist of distribution of points in 2D and 3D. We extract a set of feature vectors from normalized images using principal components analysis and using them for a binary decision tree for classification. A promising recognition rate of up to 98.75% has been achieved using 3D model and 92.93% using 2D model emphasizing the goodness of our normalization. The experiments have been performed on more than 3500 face images of the database. This algorithm is capable to work in real time in the presence of facial expressions. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the "inside-out" recognition of everyday manipulation tasks using a gaze-directed camera, which is a camera that actively directs at the visual attention focus of the person wearing the camera. We present EYEWATCHME, an integrated vision and state estimation system that at the same time tracks the positions and the poses of the acting hands, the pose that the manipulated object, and the pose of the observing camera. Taken together, EYEWATCHME provides comprehensive data for learning predictive models of vision-guided manipulation that include the objects people are attending, the interaction of attention and reaching/grasping, and the segmentation of reaching and grasping using visual attention as evidence. Key technical contributions of this paper include an ego view hand tracking system that estimates 27 DOF hand poses. The hand tracking system is capable of detecting hands and estimating their poses despite substantial selfocclusion caused by the hand and occlusions caused by the manipulated object. EYEWATCHME can also cope with blurred images that are caused by rapid eye movements. The second key contribution is the of the integrated activity recognition system that simultaneously tracks the attention of the person, the hand poses, and the poses of the manipulated objects in terms of a global scene coordinates. We demonstrate the operation of EYEWATCHME in the context of kitchen tasks including filling a cup with water. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Service Robots in real world environments need to have computer vision capability for detecting a large class of objects. We discuss how freely available 3D model databases can be used to enable robots to know the appearance of a wide variety of objects in human environments with special application to our Assistive Kitchen. However, the open and free nature of such databases pose problems for example the presence of incorrectly annotated 3D models, or objects for which very few models exist online. We have previously proposed techniques to automatically select the useful models from the search result, and utilizing such models to perform simple manipulation tasks. Here, we build upon that work, to describe a technique based on Morphing to form new 3D models if we only have a few models corresponding to a label. However, morphing in computer graphics requires a human operator and is computationally burdensome, due to which we present our own automatic morphing technique. We also present a simple technique to speed the matching process of 3D models against real scenes using Visibility culling. This technique can potentially speed-up the matching process by 2-3 times while using less memory, if we have some prior information model and world pose.},

abstract={Opportunities for interleaving or parallelizing actions are abundant in everyday activities. Being able to perceive, predict and exploit such opportunities leads to more efficient and robust behavior. In this paper, we present a mobile manipulation platform that exploits such opportunities to optimize its behavior, e.g. grasping two objects from one location simultaneously, rather than navigating to two different locations. To do so, it uses a general least-commitment representation of place, called ARPLACE, from which manipulation is predicted to be successful. Models for ARPLACEs are learned from experience using Support Vector Machines and Point Distribution Models, and take into account the robot's morphology and skill repertoire. We present a transformational planner that reasons about ARPLACEs, and applies transformation rules to its plans if more robust and efficient behavior is predicted.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a laser-based approach for door and handle identification. The approach builds on a 3D perception pipeline to annotate doors and their handles solely from sensed laser data, without any a priori model learning. In particular, we segment the parts of interest using robust geometric estimators and statistical methods applied on geometric and intensity distribution variations in the scan. We present experimental results on a mobile manipulation platform (PR2) intended for indoor manipulation tasks. We validate the approach by generating trajectories that position the robot end-effector in front of door handles and grasp the handle. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated by real world experiments conducted on a large set of doors.},

abstract={What it means for an object to be 'within reach' depends very much on the morphology and skills of a robot. In this paper, we enable a mobile manipulation robot to learn a concept of PLACE from which successful manipulation is possible through trial-and-error interaction with the environment. Due to this developmental approach, PLACE is very much grounded in observed experience, and takes the hardware and skills of the robot into account. During taskexecution, this model is used to determine optimal grasp places in a least-commitment approach. This PLACE takes into account uncertainties in both robot and target object positions, and leads to more robust behavior. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous personal robots are currently being equipped with hands and arms that have kinematic redundancy similar to those of humans. Humans exploit the redundancy in their motor system by optimizing secondary criteria. Tasks which are executed repeatedly lead to movements that are highly optimized over time, which leads to stereotypical [25] and preplanned [15] motion patterns. This stereotypical motion can be modeled well with compact models, as has been shown for locomotion [1]. In this paper, we determine compact models for human reaching and obstacle avoidance in everyday manipulation tasks, and port these models to an articulated robot. We acquire compact models by analyzing human reaching data acquired with a magnetic motion tracker with dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. The stereotypical reaching trajectories so acquired are used to train a Dynamic Movement Primitive [12], which is executed on the robot. This enables the robot not only to follow these trajectories accurately, but also uses the compact model to predict and execute further human trajectories. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Human machine interaction is one of the emerging fields for the coming years. Interacting with others in our daily life is a face to face interaction. Faces are the natural way of interaction between humans and hence also useful in human machine interaction. This paper describes a novel technique to recognize the human facial expressions and manipulating this task for human machine interaction. We use 2D model based approach for human facial expression recognition. An active shape model (ASM) is fitted to the face image and texture information is extraced. This shape and texture information is combined with optical flow based temporal information of the image sequences to form a feature vector for the image. We experimented on image sequences of 97 different persons of Cohn-Kanade-Facial Expression Database. A classification rate of 92.4% is obtained using a binary decision tree classifier, whereas a classification rate of 96.4% is obtained using pairwise classifier based on support vector machines. This system is capable to work in realtime. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Tracking multiple targets with similiar appearance is a common task in computer vision applications, especially in sports games. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Resampling Particle Filter (RBRPF) as an implementable real-time continuation of a state-of-the-art multi-target tracking method. Target configurations are tracked by sampling associations and solving single-target tracking problems by Kalman filters. As an advantage of the new method the independence assumption between data associations is relaxed to increase the robustness in the sports domain. Smart resampling and memoization is introduced to equip the tracking method with real-time capabilities in the first place. The probabilistic framework allows for consideration of appearance models and the fusion of different sensors. We demonstrate its applicability to real world applications by tracking soccer players captured by multiple cameras through occlusions in real-time.},

abstract={This paper investigates the recognition of human actions from three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds that encode the motions of people acting in sensor-distributed indoor environments. Data streams are time sequences of silhouettes extracted from cameras in the environment. From the 2-D silhouette contours we generate space-time streams by continuously aligning and stacking the contours along the time axis as third spatial dimension. The space-time stream of an observation sequence is segmented into parts corresponding to subactions using a pattern matching technique based on suffix trees and interval scheduling. Then, the segmented space-time shapes are processed by treating the shapes as 3-D point clouds and estimating global point feature histograms for them. The resultant models are clustered using statistical analysis and our experimental results indicate that the presented methods robustly derive different action classes. This holds despite large intra-class variance in the recorded datasets due to performances from different persons at different time intervals. © 2009 VSP.},

abstract={In this article we present the complete details of the architecture and implementation of Leaving Flatland, an exploratory project that attempts to surmount the challenges of closing the loop between autonomous perception and action on challenging terrain. The proposed system includes comprehensive localization, mapping, path planning, and visualization techniques for a mobile robot to operate autonomously in complex three- dimensional (3D) indoor and outdoor environments. In doing so we integrate robust visual odometry localization techniques with real-time 3D mapping methods from stereo data to obtain consistent global models annotated with semantic labels. These models are used by a multiregion motion planner that adapts existing two-dimensional planning techniques to operate in 3D terrain.

abstract={This paper describes a comprehensive approach to extract a common feature set from the image sequences. We use simple features which are easily extracted from a 3D wireframe model and efficiently used for different applications on a benchmark database. Features verstality is experimented on facial expressions recognition, face reognition and gender classification. We experiment different combinations of the features and find reasonable results with a combined features approach which contain structural, textural and temporal variations. The idea follows in fitting a model to human face images and extracting shape and texture information. We parametrize these extracted information from the image sequences using active appearance model (AAM) approach. We further compute temporal parameters using optical flow to consider local feature variations. Finally we combine these parameters to form a feature vector for all the images in our database. These features are then experimented with binary decision tree (BDT) and Bayesian Network (BN) for classification. We evaluated our results on image sequences of Cohn Kanade Facial Expression Database (CKFED). The proposed system produced very promising recognition rates for our applications with same set of features and classifiers. The system is also realtime capable and automatic. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper describes an idea of recognizing the human face in the presence of strong facial expressions using model based approach. The features extracted for the face image sequences can be efficiently used for face recognition. The approach follows in 1) modeling an active appearance model (AAM) parameters for the face image, 2) using optical flow based temporal features for facial expression variations estimation, 3) and finally applying classifier for face recognition. The novelty lies not only in generation of appearance models which is obtained by fitting active shape model (ASM) to the face image using objective functions but also using a feature vector which is the combination of shape, texture and temporal parameters that is robust against facial expression variations. Experiments have been performed on Cohn- Kanade facial expression database using 62 subjects of the database with image sequences consisting of more than 4000 images. This achieved successful face recognition rate up to 91.17% using binary decision tree (BDT), 98.6% using Bayesian Networks (BN) with 10-fold cross validation in the presence of six different facial expressions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract={We propose Merge Growing Neural Gas (MGNG) as a novel unsupervised growing neural network for time series analysis. MGNG combines the state-of-the-art recursive temporal context of Merge Neural Gas (MNG) with the incremental Growing Neural Gas (GNG) and enables thereby the analysis of unbounded and possibly infinite time series in an online manner. There is no need to define the number of neurons a priori and only constant parameters are used. In order to focus on frequent sequence patterns an entropy maximization strategy is utilized which controls the creation of new neurons. Experimental results demonstrate reduced time complexity compared to MNG while retaining similar accuracy in time series representation. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper describes an efficient approach for face recognition as a two step process: 1) segmenting the face region from an image by using an appearance based model, 2) using eigenfaces for person identification for segmented face region. The efficiency lies not only in generation of appearance models which uses the explicit approach for shape and texture but also the combined use of the aforementioned techniques. The result is an algorithm that is robust against facial expressions variances. Moreover it reduces the amount of texture up to 12% of the image texture instead of considering whole face image. Experiments have been performed on Cohn Kanade facial database using ten subjects for training and seven for testing purposes. This achieved a successful face recognition rate up to 92.85% with and without facial expressions. Face recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is fast and efficient to use, while the extracted appearance model can be further used for facial recognition and tracking under lighting and pose variations. This combination is simple to model and apply in real time.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel way of characterizing the local geometry of 3D points, using persistent feature histograms. The relationships between the neighbors of a point are analyzed and the resulted values are stored in a 16-bin histogram. The histograms are pose and point cloud density invariant and cope well with noisy datasets. We show that geometric primitives have unique signatures in this feature space, preserved even in the presence of additive noise. To extract a compact subset of points which characterizes a point cloud dataset, we perform an in-depth analysis of all point feature histograms using different distance metrics. Preliminary results show that point clouds can be roughly segmented based on the uniqueness of geometric primitives feature histograms. We validate our approach on datasets acquired from laser sensors in indoor (kitchen) environments. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the usage of persistent point feature histograms for the problem of aligning point cloud data views into a consistent global model. Given a collection of noisy point clouds, our algorithm estimates a set of robust 16D features which describe the geometry of each point locally. By analyzing the persistence of the features at different scales, we extract an optimal set which best characterizes a given point cloud. The resulted persistent features are used in an initial alignment algorithm to estimate a rigid transformation that approximately registers the input datasets. The algorithm provides good starting points for iterative registration algorithms such as ICP (Iterative Closest Point), by transforming the datasets to its convergence basin. We show that our approach is invariant to pose and sampling density, and can cope well with noisy data coming from both indoor and outdoor laser scans. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={For mobile manipulators envisioned in home environments a kitchen scenario provides a challenging testbed for numerous skills. Diverse manipulation actions are required, e.g. simple pick and place for moving objects and constrained motions for opening doors and drawers. The robot kinematics and link limits however are restrictive. Therefore especially a constrained trajectory will not be executable from arbitrary placements of the mobile manipulator. A two stage approach is presented to position a mobile manipulator to execute constrained linear trajectories as needed for opening drawers. In a first stage, a representation of a robot arm's reachable workspace is computed. Pattern recognition techniques are used to find regions in the workspace representation where these trajectories are possible. A set of trajectories results. In the second stage mobile manipulator placements are computed and the corresponding trajectories are checked for collisions. Compared to a brute force search through the workspace, the success rate of finding a mobile manipulator placement can be increased from 2% to 70%. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a set of methods for building informative and robust feature point representations, used for accurately labeling points in a 3D point cloud, based on the type of surface the point is lying on. The feature space comprises a multi-value histogram which characterizes the local geometry around a query point, is pose and sampling density invariant, and can cope well with noisy sensor data. We characterize 3D geometric primitives of interest and describe methods for obtaining discriminating features used in a machine learning algorithm. To validate our approach, we perform an in-depth analysis using different classifiers and show results with both synthetically generated datasets and real-world scans. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the acquisition of 3D functional object maps for indoor household environments, in particular kitchens, out of 3D point cloud data. By modeling the static objects in the world into hierarchical classes in the map, such as cupboards, tables, drawers, and kitchen appliances, we create a library of objects which a household robotic assistant can use while performing its tasks. Our method takes a complete 3D point cloud model as input, and computes an object model for it. The objects have states (such as open and closed), and the resultant model is accurate enough to use it in physics-based simulations, where the doors can be opened based on their hinge position. The model is built through a series of geometrical reasoning steps, namely: planar segmentation, cuboid decomposition, fixture recognition and interpretation (e.g. handles and knobs), and object classification based on object state information. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={We report our first experiences with Leaving Flatland, an exploratory project which studies the key challenges in closing the loop on autonomous perception and action in challenging terrain. A primary objective of the project is to demonstrate the acquisition and processing of robust 3D geometric model maps from stereo data and Visual Odometry techniques. The 3D geometric model is used to infer different terrain types and construct a 3D semantic model which can be used for path planning or teleoperation. This paper presents the set of methods and techniques used for building such a model, and provides insight on the mathematical optimizations used for obtaining realtime processing. To validate our approach, we show results obtained on multiple datasets and perform a comparison with other similar initiatives. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={One of the main challenges in motor control is expressing high-level goals in terms of low-level actions. To do so effectively, motor control systems must reason about actions at different levels of abstraction. Grounding high-level plans in low-level actions is essential semantic knowledge for plan-based control of real robots. We present a robot control system that uses declarative, procedural and predictive knowledge to generate, execute and optimize plans. Declarative knowledge is represented in PDDL, durative actions constitute procedural knowledge, and predictive knowledge is learned by observing action executions. We demonstrate how learned predictive knowledge enables robots to autonomously optimize plan execution with respect to execution duration and robustness in real-time. The approach is evaluated in two different robotic domains. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article investigates the problem of acquiring 3D object maps of indoor household environments, in particular kitchens. The objects modeled in these maps include cupboards, tables, drawers and shelves, which are of particular importance for a household robotic assistant. Our mapping approach is based on PCD (point cloud data) representations. Sophisticated interpretation methods operating on these representations eliminate noise and resample the data without deleting the important details, and interpret the improved point clouds in terms of rectangular planes and 3D geometric shapes. We detail the steps of our mapping approach and explain the key techniques that make it work. The novel techniques include statistical analysis, persistent histogram features estimation that allows for a consistent registration, resampling with additional robust fitting techniques, and segmentation of the environment into meaningful regions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={While current manufacturing systems are built to avoid uncertainty, the increase of setup reconfiguration frequency and ever higher numbers of variants produced on the same systems motivate the exploration of new approaches to manufacturing and manufacturing control. In this paper we discuss the application of plan based controllers and transformational planning in manufacturing. Autonomous control techniques are used to create flexible, robust and adaptive behaviour in the artificial intelligence community for about 20 years. In order to show the applicability and adequacy of plan based control in manufacturing, we examplijy the approach in a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). The experiments show that significant performance boosts are possible through transformational planning. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Our goal is to develop intelligent service robots that operate in standard human environments, automating common tasks. In pursuit of this goal, we follow the ubiquitous robotics paradigm, in which intelligent perception and control, are combined with ubiquitous computing. By exploiting sensors and effectors in its environment, a robot can perform more complex tasks without becoming overly complex itself. Following this insight, we have developed a service robot that operates autonomously in a sensor-equipped kitchen. The robot learns from demonstration, and performs sophisticated tasks, in concert with the network of devices in its environment. We report on the design, implementation, and usage of this system, which is freely available for use, and improvement by others, in the research community. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When humans perform a simple grasping movement (e.g., when they pick-up a bottle) in different task contexts (e.g., with the intention to place the bottle at another location or to pour water into a glass), the respective grasping movement is adapted on-line to the task requirements and executed in a fast, precise and smooth way. We investigated whether and how different types of after-grasp movements affected the planning and execution of the same initial grasping segment. If future actions are anticipated and integrated into the execution of an ongoing movement, then parameters of the initial grasping movement should be altered dependent on requirements of the subsequent after-grasp movement. Results indeed showed a strong impact of the after-grasp movement on initial grasping. Participants adopted their grip position to the goal position of the after-grasp movement. Additionally, temporal parameters (such as movement time, timing of peak velocity, acceleration and deceleration) were affected by the after-grasp movement type. These results indicate that parameters of the after-grasp movement were anticipated already at an early motor planning stage. Possible implications on robot control are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present our work on human action recognition in intelligent environments. We classify actions by looking at a time-sequence of silhouettes extracted from various camera images. By treating time as the third spatial dimension we generate so-called space-time shapes that contain rich information about the actions. We propose a novel approach for recognizing actions, by representing the shapes as 3D point clouds and estimating feature histograms for them. Preliminary results show that our method robustly derives different classes of actions, even in the presence of large variability in the data, coming from different persons at different time intervals. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes GrAM (Grounded Action Models), a novel integration of actions and action models into the knowledge representation and inference mechanisms of agents. In GrAM action models accord to agent behavior and can be specified explicitly and implicitly. The explicit representation is an action class specific set of Markov logic rules that predict action properties. Stated implicitly an action model defines a data mining problem that, when executed, computes the model's explicit representation. When inferred from an implicit representation the prediction rules predict typical behavior and are learned from a set of training examples, or, in other words, grounded in the respective experience of the agents. Therefore, GrAM allows for the functional and thus adaptive specification of concepts such as the class of situations in which a special action is typically executed successfully or the concept of agents that tend to execute certain kinds of actions. GrAM represents actions and their models using an upgrading of the representation language OWL and equips the Java Theorem Prover (JTP), a hybrid reasoner for OWL, with additional mechanisms that allow for the automatic acquisition of action models and solving a variety of inference tasks for actions, action models and functional descriptions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper we present our work on markerless model-based 3D human motion capture using multiple cameras. We use an industry proven anthropometric human model that was modeled taking ergonomic considerations into account. The outer surface consists of a precise yet compact 3D surface mesh that is mostly rigid on body part level apart from some small but important torsion deformations. Benefits are the ability to capture a great amount of possible human appearances with high accuracy while still having a simple to use and computationally efficient model. We have introduced special optimizations such as caching into the model to improve its performance in tracking applications. Available force and comfort measures within the model provide further opportunities for future research. 3D articulated pose estimation is performed in a Bayesian framework, using a set of hierarchically coupled local particle filters for tracking. This makes it possible to sample efficiently from the high dimensional space of articulated human poses without constraining the allowed movements. Sequences of tracked upper-body as well as full-body motions captured by three cameras show promising results. Despite the high dimensionality of our model (51 DOF) we succeed at tracking using only silhouette overlap as weighting function due to the precise outer appearance of our model and the hierarchical decomposition. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Robots reason about abstract actions, such as go to position 'l', in order to decide what to do or to generate plans for their intended course of action. The use of abstract actions enables robots to employ small action libraries, which reduces the search space for decision making. When executing the actions, however, the robot must tailor the abstract actions to the specific task and situation context at hand. In this article we propose a novel robot action execution system that learns success and performance models for possible specializations of abstract actions. At execution time, the robot uses these models to optimize the execution of abstract actions to the respective task contexts. The robot can so use abstract actions for efficient reasoning, without compromising the performance of action execution. We show the impact of our action execution model in three robotic domains and on two kinds of action execution problems: (1) the instantiation of free action parameters to optimize the expected performance of action sequences; (2) the automatic introduction of additional subgoals to make action sequences more reliable. © 2008 AI Access Foundation.

abstract={A common approach to the problem of 3D human pose estimation from video is to recursively estimate the most likely pose via particle filtering. However, standard particle filtering methods fail the task due to the high dimensionality of the 3D articulated human pose space. In this paper we present a thorough evaluation of two variants of particle filtering, namely Annealed Particle Filtering and Partitioned Sampling, that have been proposed to make the problem feasible by exploiting the hierarchical structures inside the pose space. We evaluate both methods in the context of markerless model-based 3D motion capture using silhouette shapes from multiple cameras. For that we created a simulation from ground truth sequences of human motions, which enables us to focus our evaluation on the sampling capabilities of the approaches, i.e. on how efficient particles are spread towards the modes of the distribution. We show the behavior with respect to the number of cameras used, the number of particles used, as well as the dimensionality of the search space. Especially the performance when using more complex human models (∼ 40 DOF and above) that are able to capture human movements with higher precision compared to previous approaches is of interest in this work. In summary, we show that both methods have complementary strengths, and propose a combined method that is able to perform the tracking task with higher robustness despite reduced computational effort.},

We show as a proof of concept that general transformation rules can be formulated that achieve substantially and significantly improved performance using table setting as an example.

abstract={Water surface moving targets tracking is a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. Because moving targets are in a cluttered environment and are occluded randomly by splashed water, it is difficult to accurately extract and track them. In this paper, by analyzing water surface's color and motion statistical characters, a two-step segmentation algorithm is proposed to extract these targets. Then a multi-view tracking system is established to estimate the 3D trajectory of moving targets' center. We employ this system to canoe competition, and compare our result with the standard 3D trajectories, which can be calculated by using the markers on the canoes. The experiments show that the root median square error between our trajectories and the standard ones is very low.},

abstract={This paper describes a mapping system that acquires 3D object models of man-made indoor environments such as kitchens. The system segments and geometrically reconstructs cabinets with doors, tables, drawers, and shelves, objects that are important for robots retrieving and manipulating objects in these environments. The system also acquires models of objects of daily use such glasses, plates, and ingredients. The models enable the recognition of the objects in cluttered scenes and the classification of newly encountered objects. Key technical contributions include (1) a robust, accurate, and efficient algorithm for constructing complete object models from 3D point clouds constituting partial object views, (2) feature-based recognition procedures for cabinets, tables, and other task-relevant furniture objects, and (3) automatic inference of object instance and class signatures for objects of daily use that enable robots to reliably recognize the objects in cluttered and real task contexts. We present results from the sensor-based mapping of a real kitchen. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes ASPOGAMO, a visual tracking system that determines the coordinates and trajectories of football players in camera view based on TV broadcasts. To do so, ASPOGAMO solves a complex probabilistic estimation problem that consists of three subproblems that interact in subtle ways: the estimation of the camera direction and zoom factor, the tracking and smoothing of player routes, and the disambiguation of tracked players after occlusions. The paper concentrates on system aspects that make it suitable for operating under unconstrained conditions and in (almost) realtime. We report on results obtained in a public demonstration at RoboCup 2006 where we conducted extensive experiments with real data from live coverage of World Cup 2006 games in Germany.},

abstract={One of the most notable and recognizable features of robot motion is the abrupt transitions between actions in action sequences. In contrast, humans and animals perform sequences of actions efficiently, and with seamless transitions between subsequent actions. This smoothness is not a goal in itself, but a side-effect of the evolutionary optimization of other performance measures. In this paper, we argue that such jagged motion is an inevitable consequence of the way human designers and planners reason about abstract actions. We then present subgoal refinement, a procedure that optimizes action sequences. Subgoal refinement determines action parameters that are not relevant to why the action was selected, and optimizes these parameters with respect to expected execution performance. This performance is computed using action models, which are learned from observed experience.

abstract={Reinforcement learning is a very general unsupervised learning mechanism. Due to its generality reinforcement learning does not scale very well for tasks that involve inferring subtasks. In particular when the subtasks are dynamically changing and the environment is adversarial. One of the most challenging reinforcement learning tasks so far has been the 3 to 2 keepaway task in the RoboCup simulation league. In this paper we apply reinforcement learning to a even more challenging task: attacking the opponents goal. The main contribution of this paper is the empirical analysis of a portfolio of mechanisms for scaling reinforcement learning towards learning attack policies in simulated robot soccer. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Markov logic, as a highly expressive representation formalism that essentially combines the semantics of probabilistic graphical models with the full power of first-order logic, is one of the most intriguing representations in the field of probabilistic logical modelling. However, as we will show, models in Markov logic often fail to generalize because the parameters they contain are highly domain-specific. We take the perspective of generative stochastic processes in order to describe probability distributions in relational domains and illustrate the problem in this context by means of simple examples. We propose an extension of the language that involves the specification of a priori independent attributes and that furthermore introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment whenever a model in Markov logic is instantiated for a certain domain (set of objects). Our extension removes the corresponding restrictions on processes for which models can be learned using standard methods and thus enables Markov logic networks to be practically applied to a far greater class of generative stochastic processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Many application tasks require the cooperation of two or more robots. Humans are good at cooperation in shared workspaces, because they anticipate and adapt to the intentions and actions of others. In contrast, multi-agent and multi-robot systems rely on communication to exchange their intentions. This causes problems in domains where perfect communication is not guaranteed, such as rescue robotics, autonomous vehicles participating in traffic, or robotic soccer. In this paper, we introduce a computational model for implicit coordination, and apply it to a typical coordination task from robotic soccer: regaining ball possession. The computational model specifies that performance prediction models are necessary for coordination, so we learn them off-line from observed experience. By taking the perspective of the team mates, these models are then used to predict utilities of others, and optimize a shared performance model for joint actions. In several experiments conducted with our robotic soccer team, we evaluate the performance of implicit coordination. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={As agent systems are solving more and more complex tasks in increasingly challenging domains, the systems themselves are becoming more complex too, often compromising their adaptivity and robustness. A promising approach to solve this problem is to provide agents with reflective capabilities. Agents that can reflect on the effects and expected performance of their actions, are more aware and knowledgeable of their capabilities and shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce a computational model for what we call action awareness. To achieve this awareness, agents learn predictive action models from observed experience. This knowledge is then used to optimize, transform and coordinate plans. We apply this computational model to a number of typical scenarios from robotic soccer. Various experiments on real robots demonstrate that action awareness enables the robots to improve the performance of their plans substantially. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={As we are deploying planning mechanisms in real-world applications, such as the control of autonomous robots, it becomes apparent that the performance of plan-based controllers critically depends on the design and implementation of plan libraries. Despite its importance the investigation of designs of plan libraries and plans has been largely ignored. In this paper we describe parts of a plan library that we are currently developing and applying to the control of a simulated household robot. The salient features of our plans are that they are designed for reliable, flexible, and optimized execution, and are grounded into sensor data and action routines. We provide empirical evidence that design criteria that we are proposing have considerable impact on the performance level of robots.

abstract={Skin color is an important feature of faces. Various applications benefit from robust skin color detection. Depending on camera settings, illumination, shadows, people's tans, and ethnic groups skin color looks differently, which is a challenging aspect for detecting it automatically. In this paper, we present an approach that uses a high level vision module to detect an image specific skin color model. This model is then used to adapt parametric skin color classifiers to the processed image. This approach is capable to distinguish skin color from extremely similar colors, such as lip color or eyebrow color. Its high speed and high accuracy make it appropriate for real time applications such as face tracking and recognition of facial expressions. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The implementation of high-performance robot controllers for complex control tasks such as playing autonomous robot soccer is tedious, error-prone, and a never ending programming task. In this paper we propose programmers to write autonomous controllers that optimize and automatically adapt themselves to changing circumstances of task execution using explicit perception, dynamics and action models. To this end we develop RoLL (Robot Learning Language), a control language allowing for model-based robot programming. RoLL provides language constructs for specifying executable code pieces of how to learn and update these models.We are currently using RoLL's mechanisms for implementing a rational reconstruction of our soccer robot controllers.},

abstract={Many plan-based autonomous robot controllers generate chains of abstract actions in order to achieve complex, dynamically changing, and possibly interacting goals. The execution of these action chains often results in robot behavior that shows abrupt transitions between subsequent actions, causing suboptimal performance. The resulting motion patterns are so characteristic for robots that people imitating robotic behavior will do so by making abrupt movements between actions. In this paper we propose a novel computation model for the execution of abstract action chains. In this computation model a robot first learns situation-specific performance models of abstract actions. It then uses these models to automatically specialize the abstract actions for their execution in a given action chain. This specialization results in refined chains that are optimized for performance. As a side effect this behavior optimization also appears to produce action chains with seamless transitions between actions.},

abstract={In this paper we present an overview of recent developments in the plan-based control of autonomous robots. We identify computational principles that enable autonomous robots to accomplish complex, diverse, and dynamically changing tasks in challenging environments. These principles include plan-based high-level control, probabilistic reasoning, plan transformation, and context and resource-adaptive reasoning. We will argue that the development of comprehensive and integrated computational models of plan-based control requires us to consider different aspects of plan-based control - plan representation, reasoning, execution, and learning - together and not in isolation. This integrated approach enables us to exploit synergies between the different aspects and thereby come up with simpler and more powerful computational models. In the second part of the paper we describe Structured Reactive Controllers (SRCs), our own approach to the development of a comprehensive computational model for the plan-based control of robotic agents. We show how the principles, described in the first part of the paper, are incorporated into the SRCs and summarize results of several long-term experiments that demonstrate the practicality of SRCs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={This article develops Probabilistic Hybrid Action Models (PHAMS), a realistic causal model for predicting the behavior generated by modern percept-driven robot plans. PHAMS represent aspects of robot behavior that cannot be represented by most action models used in AI planning: the temporal structure of continuous control processes, their non-deterministic effects, several modes of their interferences, and the achievement of triggering conditions in closed-loop robot plans. The main contributions of this article are: (1) PHAMS, a model of concurrent percept-driven behavior, its formalization, and proofs that the model generates probably, qualitatively accurate predictions; and (2) a resource-efficient inference method for PHAMS based on sampling projections from probabilistic action models and state descriptions. We show how PHAMS can be applied to planning the course of action of an autonomous robot office courier based on analytical and experimental results. ©2005 AI Access Foundation.

abstract={One of the key problems in the study of multi agent systems in which the agents exhibit continuous behavior is the automatic recognition and analysis of intentional activities based on observable behavior. Such an analysis requires software systems to structure motions into episodes that are meaningful in the application domains, to acquire and maintain models of the activities, and to use such models to reason about multi agent system behavior. In the research sketched in this paper we study the acquisition of episode and motion models for football games. We show that these models allow for the realization of impressive application systems including interactive football TV and agent systems that assist coaches in analyzing their teams.},

abstract={The task of fitting parametric curve models to the boundaries of perceptually meaningful image regions is a key problem in computer vision with numerous applications, such as image segmentation, pose estimation, object tracking, and 3-D reconstruction. In this article, we propose the Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm as a solution to the curve-fitting problem. The CCD algorithm extends the state-of-the-art in two important ways. First, it applies a novel likelihood function for the assessment of a fit between the curve model and the image data. This likelihood function can cope with highly inhomogeneous image regions, because it is formulated in terms of local image statistics. The local image statistics are learned on the fly from the vicinity of the expected curve. They provide therefore locally adapted criteria for separating the adjacent image regions. These local criteria replace often used predefined fixed criteria that rely on homogeneous image regions or specific edge properties. The second contribution is the use of blurred curve models as efficient means for iteratively optimizing the posterior density over possible model parameters. These blurred curve models enable the algorithm to trade-off two conflicting objectives, namely heaving a large area of convergence and achieving high accuracy. We apply the CCD algorithm to several challenging image segmentation and 3-D pose estimation problems. Our experiments with RGB images show that the CCD algorithm achieves a high level of robustness and subpixel accuracy even in the presence of severe texture, shading, clutter, partial occlusion, and strong changes of illumination.},

abstract={This article describes the computational model underlying the AGILO autonomous robot soccer team, its implementation, and our experiences with it. According to our model the control system of an autonomous soccer robot consists of a probabilistic game state estimator and a situated action selection module. The game state estimator computes the robot's belief state with respect to the current game situation using a simple off-the-shelf camera system. The estimated game state comprises the positions and dynamic states of the robot itself and its teammates as well as the positions of the ball and the opponent players. Employing sophisticated probabilistic reasoning techniques and exploiting the cooperation between team mates, the robot can estimate complex game states reliably and accurately despite incomplete and inaccurate sensor information. The action selection module selects actions according to specified selection criteria as well as learned experiences. Automatic learning techniques made it possible to develop fast and skillful routines for approaching the ball, assigning roles, and performing coordinated plays. The paper discusses the computational techniques based on experimental data from the 2001 robot soccer world championship.},

abstract={State-of-the-art robot mapping approaches are capable of acquiring impressively accurate 2D and 3D models of their environments. To the best of our knowledge few of them can acquire models of task-relevant objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for acquiring models of task-relevant objects from stereo images. The proposed algorithm applies methods from projective geometry and works for rectangular objects, which are, in office- and museum-like environments, the most commonly found subclass of geometric objects. The method is shown to work accurately and for a wide range of viewing angles and distances.},

abstract={Due to the complexity and sophistication of the skills needed in real world tasks, the development of autonomous robot controllers requires an ever increasing application of learning techniques. To date, however, learning steps are mainly executed in isolation and only the learned code pieces become part of the controller. This approach has several drawbacks: the learning steps themselves are undocumented and not executable. In this paper, we extend an existing control language with constructs for specifying control tasks, process models, learning problems, exploration strategies, etc. Using these constructs, the learning problems can be represented explicitly and transparently and, as they are part of the overall program implementation, become executable. With the extended language we rationally reconstruct large parts of the action selection module of the AGILO2001 autonomous soccer robots. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

abstract={Good soccer players must keep their eyes on their opponents in order to make the right plays and moves. The same holds for soccer robots, too. In this paper, we apply probabilistic multiple object tracking to the continual estimation of the positions of opponent players in autonomous robot soccer. We extend MHT [3], an existing tracking algorithm, to handle multiple mobile sensors with uncertain positions, discuss the specification of probabilistic models needed by the algorithm, and describe the required vision-interpretation algorithms. The tracking algorithm enables robots to estimate the positions and motions of fast moving robots both accurately and robustly. We have applied the multiple object tracking algorithm throughout the RoboCup 2001 world championship. Empirical results show the applicability of multiple hypotheses tracking to vision-based opponent tracking and demonstrates the advantages for crowded environments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={Object recognition and localization methods in RoboCup work on color segmented camera images. Unfortunately, color labeling can be applied to object recognition tasks only in very restricted environments, where different kinds of objects have different colors. To overcome these limitations we propose an algorithm named the Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm for fitting parametric curves to image data. The method neither assumes object specific color distributions, nor specific edge profiles, nor does it need threshold parameters. Hence, no training phase is needed. In order to separate adjacent regions we use local criteria which are based on local image statistics. We apply the method to the problem of localizing the ball and show that the CCD algorithm reliably localizes the ball even in the presence of heavily changing illumination, strong clutter, specularity, partial occlusion, and texture. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={Typical real world machine control tasks have some characteristics which makes them difficult to solve: Their state spaces are high-dimensional and continuous, and it may be impossible to reach a satisfying target state by exploration or human control. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose (1) to use radial basis functions for value function approximation in continuous space reinforcement learning and (2) the use of learned inverse projection functions for state space exploration. We apply our approach to path planning in dynamic environments and to an. aircraft autolanding simulation, and evaluate its performance.},

abstract={With the services that autonomous robots are to provide becoming more demanding, the states that the robots have to estimate become more complex. In this paper, we develop and analyze a probabilistic, vision-based state estimation method for individual autonomous robots. This method enables a team of mobile robots to estimate their joint positions in a known environment and track the positions of autonomously moving objects. The state estimators of different robots cooperate to increase the accuracy and reliability of the estimation process. This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have lost track of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots.},

abstract={Most state-of-the-art navigation systems for autonomous service robots decompose navigation into global navigation planning and local (reactive) navigation. While the methods for navigation planning and local navigation themselves are well understood, the plan execution problem, the problem of how to generate and parameterize local navigation actions from a given navigation plan, is largely unsolved. This article describes how a robot can autonomously learn to execute navigation plans. We investigate how the robot can acquire causal models of the actions executable by the local navigation system and we develop a decision theoretic action selection function which uses the models learned to execute a given navigation plan. Finally, we show, both in simulation and on a RWI B21 mobile robot, that the learned action selection function improves the robot's navigation performance compared to standard plan execution techniques.},

abstract={Most state-of-the-art navigation systems for autonomous service robots decompose navigation into global navigation planning and local reactive navigation. While the methods for navigation planning and local navigation themselves are well understood, the plan execution problem, the problem of how to generate and parameterize local navigation tasks from a given navigation plan is largely unsolved. This paper describes how a robot can autonomously learn to execute navigation plans. We formalize the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and derive a decision theoretic action selection function from it. The action selection function employs models of the robot's navigation actions, which are autonomously acquired from experience using neural networks or regression tree learning algorithms. We show, both in simulation and on an RWI B21 mobile robot, that the learned models together with the derived action selection function achieve competent navigation behavior. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Robotic soccer has become a standard “real-world” testbed for autonomous robot control. This paper presents our current views on the use of plan-based control mechanisms for autonomous robotic soccer. We argue that plan-based control will enable autonomous soccer playing robots to better perform sophisticated and fine tuned soccer plays. We present and discuss some of the plan representations that we have developed for robotic soccer. Finally, we outline extensions of our plan representation language that allow for the explicit and transparent specification of learning problems within plans. This extended language enables robot controllers to employ learning subplans that can be reasoned about and manipulated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

abstract={In many multi-robot applications, such as robot soccer, robot rescue, and exploration, a reliable coordination of robots is required. Robot teams in these applications should therefore be equipped with coordination mechanisms that work robustly despite communication capabilities being corrupted. In this paper we propose a coordination mechanism in which each robot first computes a global task assignment for the team that minimizes the cost of achieving all tasks, and then executes the task assigned to itself. In this coordination mechanism a robot can infer the intentions of its team mates given their belief states. Lack of information caused by communication failures causes an increase of uncertainty with respect to the belief states of team mates. The cost of task achievement is estimated by a sophisticated temporal projection module that exploits learned dynamical models of the robots. We will show in experiments, both on real and simulated robots, that our coordination mechanism produces well coordinated behavior and that the coherence of task assignments gracefully degrades with communication failures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a hybrid navigation planning and execution system for performing joint navigation tasks in autonomous robot soccer. The proposed system consists of three components: an artificial neural network controller, a library of software tools for planning and plan merging, and a decision module that selects the appropriate planning and execution methods in a situation-specific way. The system learns by experimentation predictive models for the performance of different navigation planning methods. The decision module uses the learned predictive models to select the most promising planning method for the given navigation task. In extensive experiments using a realistic and accurate robot simulator that has learned the dynamic model of the real robots we show that our navigation system is capable to (1) generate fast and smooth navigation trajectories and (2) outperform the state of the art planning methods. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper describes the AGILO RoboCuppers 1 the RoboCup team of the image understanding group (FG BV) at the Technische Universität München. With a team of four Pioneer I robots, all equipped with CCD camera and a single board computer, we've participated in all international middle size league tournaments from 1998 until 2001. We use a modular approach of concurrent subprograms for image processing, self localization, object tracking, action selection, path planning and basic robot control. A fast feature extraction process provides the data necessary for the on-board scene interpretation. All robot observations are fused into a single environmental model, which forms the basis for action selection, path planning and low-level robot control. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many robot learning tasks are very difficult to solve: their state spaces are high dimensional, variables and command parameters are continuously valued, and system states are only partly observable. In this paper, we propose to learn a continuous space value function for reinforcement learning using neural networks trained from data of exploration runs. The learned function is guaranteed to be a lower bound for, and reproduces the characteristic shape of, the accurate value function. We apply our approach to two robot navigation tasks, discuss how to deal with possible problems occurring in practice, and assess its performance.},

abstract={With the services that autonomous robots are to provide becoming more demanding, the states that the robots have to estimate become more complex. In this paper, we develop and analyze a probabilistic, vision-based state estimation method for individual, autonomous robots. This method enables a team of mobile robots to estimate their joint positions in a known environment and track the positions of autonomously moving objects. The state estimators of different robots cooperate to increase the accuracy and reliability of the estimation process. This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have lost track of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In many robot applications, autonomous robots must be capable of localizing the objects they are to manipulate. In this paper we address the object localization problem by fitting a parametric curve model to the object contour in the image. The initial prior of the object pose is iteratively refined to the posterior distribution by optimizing the separation of the object and the background. The local separation criteria are based on local statistics which are iteratively computed from the object and the background region. No prior knowledge on color distributions is needed. Experiments show that the method is capable of localizing objects in a cluttered and textured scene even under strong variations of illumination. The method is able to localize a soccer ball within frame rate.},

abstract={This paper describes the computational model underlying the AGILO autonomous robot soccer team, its implementation, and our experiences with it. The most salient aspects of the AGILO control software are that it includes (1) a cooperative probabilistic game state estimator working with a simple off-the-shelf camera system; (2) a situated action selection module that makes ample use of experience-based learning and produces coherent team behavior even if inter-robot communication is perturbed; and (3) a playbook executor that can perform preprogrammed complex soccer plays in appropriate situations by employing plan-based control techniques. The use of such sophisticated state estimation and control techniques distinguishes the AGILO software from many others applied to mid-size autonomous robot soccer. The paper discusses the computational techniques and necessary extensions based on experimental data from the 2001 robot soccer world championship.},

abstract={Service robots, such as autonomous office couriers or robot tourguides, must be both reliable and efficient. This requires them to flexibly interleave their tasks, exploit opportunities, quickly plan their course of action, and, if necessary, revise their intended activities. In this paper, we show how structured reactive controllers (SRCs) satisfy these requirements. The novel feature of SRCs is that they employ and reason about plans that specify and synchronize concurrent percept-driven behavior. Powerful control abstractions enable SRCs to integrate physical action, perception, planning, and communication in a uniform framework and to apply fast but imperfect computational methods without sacrificing reliability and flexibility. Concurrent plans are represented in a transparent and modular form so that automatic planning processes can reason about the plans and revise them. We present experiments in which SRCs are used to control two autonomous mobile robots. In one of them an SRC controlled the course of action of a museum tourguide robot that has operated for thirteen days, more than ninetyfour hours, completed 620 tours, and presented 2668 exhibits.},

abstract={With the services that autonomous robots are to provide becoming more demanding, the states that the robots have to estimate become more complex. In this paper, we develop and analyze a probabilistic, vision-based state estimation method for individual, autonomous robots. This method enables a team of mobile robots to estimate their joint positions in a known environment and track the positions of autonomously moving objects. The state estimators of different robots cooperate to increase the accuracy and reliability of the estimation process. This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have lost track of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots.},

abstract={Most multi robot navigation planning methods make assumptions about the kind of navigation problems they are to solve and the capabilities of the robots they are to control. Because these assumptions are implicit and not well understood, selecting the right planning method for a given application domain is an art. In this paper, we propose to select problem-adequate navigation planning methods based on empirical investigations, that is the robots should learn by experimentation to use the best planning methods. To support this development strategy we provide software tools that enable the robots to automatically learn predictive models for the performance of different navigation planning methods in a given application domain. We show, in the context of robot soccer, that a hybrid planning method that selects planning methods based on a learned predictive model outperforms the individual planning methods. The results are validated in extensive experiments using a realistic and accurate robot simulator that has learned the dynamic model of the real robots.},

abstract={Most state-of-the-art navigation systems for autonomous service robots decompose navigation into global navigation planning and local reactive navigation. While the methods for navigation planning and local navigation are well understood, the plan execution problem, the problem of how to generate and parameterize local navigation tasks from a given navigation plan, is largely unsolved. This article describes how a robot can autonomously learn to execute navigation plans. We formalize the problem as a Markov Decision Problem (mdp), discuss how it can be simplified to make its solution feasible, and describe how the robot can acquire the necessary action models. We show, both in simulation and on a RWI B21 mobile robot, that the learned models are able to produce competent navigation behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},

abstract={Autonomous robots, such as robot office couriers, need navigation routines that support flexible task execution and effective action planning. This paper describes XFRMLEARN, a system that learns structured symbolic navigation plans. Given a navigation task, XFRMLEARN learns to structure continuous navigation behavior and represents the learned structure as compact and transparent plans. The structured plans are obtained by starting with monolithical default plans that are optimized for average performance and adding subplans to improve the navigation performance for the given task. Compactness is achieved by incorporating only subplans that achieve significant performance gains. The resulting plans support action planning and opportunistic task execution. XFRMLEARN is implemented and extensively evaluated on an autonomous mobile robot.},

abstract={With the services that autonomous robots are to provide becoming more demanding, the states that the robots have to estimate become more complex. In this paper, we develop and analyze a probabilistic, vision-based state estimation method for individual, autonomous robots. This method enables a team of mobile robots to estimate their joint positions in a known environment and track the positions of autonomously moving objects. The state estimators of different robots cooperate to increase the accuracy and reliability of the estimation process. This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have losttrack of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},

abstract={A framework for runtime plan adaptation in which the plans themselves specify plan adaptation processes as subplans is proposed. The framework treats plan adaptation actions as computational processes that monitor the belief changes of the robot, and revise the current plan if the processes detect belief changes that warrant a reconsideration of the current course of action. Runtime plan adaptation is implemented using RPL (Reactive Plan Language), a plan/robot control language that provides the advanced control structures of modern event-driven programming languages. The framework for runtime plan adaptation is developed within the computational model of structured reactive controllers (SRC).},

abstract={The dynamic nature of autonomous robots' tasks requires that their image processing operations are tightly coupled to those actions within their control systems which require the visual information. While there are many image processing libraries that provide the raw image processing functionality required for autonomous robot applications, these libraries do not provide the additional functionality necessary for transparently binding image processing operations within a robot's control system. In particular, such libraries lack facilities for process scheduling, sequencing, concurrent execution and resource management. This paper describes the design and implementation of an enabling extensible system - RECIPE - for providing image processing functionality in a form that is convenient for robot control together with concrete implementation examples.},

abstract={Service robots, such as autonomous office couriers or robot tourguides, must be both reliable and efficient. This requires them to flexibly interleave their tasks, exploit opportunities, quickly plan their course of action, and, if necessary, revise their intended activities. In this paper, we show how structured reactive controllers (SRCs) satisfy these requirements. The novel feature of SRCs is that they employ and reason about plans that specify and synchronize concurrent percept-driven behavior. Powerful control abstractions enable SRCs to integrate physical action, perception, planning, and communication in a uniform framework and to apply fast but imperfect computational methods without sacrificing reliability and flexibility. Concurrent plans are represented in a transparent and modular form so that automatic planning processes can reason about the plans and revise them. We present experiments in which SRCs are used to control two autonomous mobile robots. In one of them an SRC controlled the course of action of a museums tourguide robot that has operated for thirteen days, more than ninetyfour hours, completed 620 tours, and presented 2668 exhibits.},

abstract={Acting efficiently and meeting deadlines requires autonomous robots to schedule their activities. It also requires them to act flexibly: to exploit opportunities and avoid problems as they occur. Scheduling activities to meet these requirements is an important research problem in its own right. In addition, it provides us with a problem domain where modern symbolic AI planning techniques could considerably improve the robots’ behavior. This paper describes ppsd, a novel planning technique that enables autonomous robots to impose order constraints on concurrent percept-driven plans to increase the plans’ efficiency. The basic idea is to generate a schedule under simplified conditions and then to iteratively detect, diagnose, and eliminate behavior flaws caused by the schedule based on a small number of randomly sampled symbolic execution scenarios. The paper discusses the integration of ppsd into the controller of an autonomous robot office courier and gives an example of its use. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

abstract={This paper describes a semi-automatic method for acquiring SA3D maps, maps that contain hierarchically structured 3D models of static, task relevant objects in the environment. Map acquisition is implemented as a two step process. In the first step, the robot acquires an approximate model that represents regions that might contain objects and indicate possible occluding objects. This approximate model is then used to compute appropriate locations from where camera images should be taken. Object models are reconstructed interactively through human operators who place wireframe models in the camera images captured by the robot. The method is implemented and validated on an autonomous mobile robot.},

abstract={High-level control systems are designed to enable mobile robots to successfully perform complex missions such as office delivery and surveillance tasks. For that purpose they have to control, coordinate, and monitor different kinds of subtasks like navigation, manipulation, and perception. An important aspect of the effectiveness of high-level control systems is the ability to cope with failures that occur during the execution of such subtasks. In this paper we focus on the particular subtask of estimating the position of the robot and show how to achieve its robust integration into the high-level control system. The principle of this integration is to monitor the certainty of the position estimation and to autonomously relocalize the robot whenever the uncertainty grows too large. We present a localization approach which accurately and efficiently keeps track of the robot's position. Furthermore, it provides a measure for detecting localization failures and it is able to autonomously relocalize the robot in such situations. In addition to this, we introduce structured reactive plans, which can be interrupted by such active localization processes at any point in time and allow the robot to complete its mission afterwards. Our method has been implemented and shown to be robust in long-term experiments involving a typical office delivery scenario. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Specifying communication routines transparently and explicitly aspart of robots’ plans rather than hiding them in separate modules makes robots’ communication behavior more effective, efficient, and robust. It enables robot control systems to generate, reason about and revise their communication behavior. The controllers can also synchronize the robots’ conversations with other actions and use control structures to make the communication behavior flexible and robust. In this paper, we extend RPL, a reactive plan language, to allow for controlling conversational actions. The additional constructs constitute an interface between RPL and conversational actions that is identical to the interface between RPL and continuous control processes such as navigation. The uniformity of the two interfaces and the control structures provided by RPL enable a programmer to concisely specify a wide spectrum of communication behavior. This paper describes how these extensions are implemented and used by a robot office courier. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

abstract={We describe XFRML, the transformation language of the planning system XFRM. XFRM is embedded in a simulated robot that performs jobs in a changing and partly unknown environment. XFRML allows XFRM to anticipate and forestall many common flaws in autonomous robot behavior that cannot be dealt with by other planning representations. In order to diagnose execution failures in projected execution scenarios, XFRM has to infer whether or not particular parts of the plan were projected to be executed and why. The use of XFRML makes such inferences possible because XFRML not only represents the physical effects of plan execution, but also the process of plan interpretation, as well as temporal, causal, and teleological relationships among plan interpretation, the world, and the physical behavior of the robot.},

abstract={Classical planning started with goals and produced plans. To do something similar in a reactive framework, it is necessary to treat the achievement or maintenance of a goal as specifying a default behavior, while at the same time being able to deploy tools to generate more complex plans. These tools rely on representing the relations between goals and plan patterns that achieve them. An important component of the representation is a set of fast, local methods for making probabilistic estimations of the quality of proposed plans, including their robustness, completeness, and efficiency.},
