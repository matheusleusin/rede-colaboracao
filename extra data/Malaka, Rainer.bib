abstract={Introduction: Bühler's anastomosis (or Bühler's arcade) is an embryonic relic and represents an arterio-arterial connection between the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk. It can be found as a variety in 1–2% of patients. Case Presentation: We present a case of a patient with metatastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The patient was in stable disease for 4 years under palliative therapy (most recently second-line therapy with Nevolumab). In 2019, a locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the papilla vateri was diagnosed, additionally. The patient also underwent right hemicolectomy and patch plasty of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery due to colonic ischemia and arteriosclerotic disease with 50–70% stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery several years ago. Due to a complex vascular prehistory, the standardized preoperative imaging was supplemented by two independent vascular reconstructions (a CT angiogram and a reconstruction based on the CT) for the planning of a pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection and reconstruction according to Traverso-Longmire. In addition, a 3D print was produced. Both, the reconstruction based on the CT scan and the 3D print were created for off-label use as a part of a research project (VIVATOP: Versatile Immersive Virtual and Augmented Tangible OP). Discussion: In the standardized CT scan and in the clinical CT-angiography, there were no obvious surgically relevant anatomical variations. A Bühler anastomosis was detected in a digital, virtual and interactive 3D-reconstruction. In addition, in the 3D print of the abdominal site the anastomosis was seen as well. Intraoperatively, the presence of Bühler's anastomosis was confirmed. This information had a significant impact on the intraoperative approach. Retrospectively, the vessel variant could be surmised in the axial projection of the CT scan, if one knew what to look for. Conclusion: For the conduction of a safe surgical procedure, it is imperative that rare anatomical variations are known preoperatively. Increasing digitalization in surgical and perioperative preparation holds great potential for better planning and improved patient safety. Research and cooperation projects such as the VIVATOP project are instrumental for the development of new visualization techniques, which are able to enhance the understanding of complex anatomical relations. © Copyright © 2020 Templin, Tabriz, Hoffmann, Uslar, Lück, Schenk, Malaka, Zachmann, Kluge and Weyhe.},

abstract={The case study presented in this paper is concerned with the applicability of natural user interfaces (NUI) in the context of previsualization (previs). For this purpose, we have developed a virtual reality (VR) based tool that includes NUIs as a novel way to perform previs-related tasks. For the application domains of animation, film, and theater, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the prototype by realising projects that resembled real life productions in the creative industries. In collaboration with industry experts with different creative backgrounds, we conducted a large-scale evaluation and examined the potential of NUIs in a professional work context. Our results indicate that NUIs can offer a usable alternative to standard 3D design software, requiring only a short familiarization phase instead of extensive training to achieve the intended outcome. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Balancing games and producing content that remains interesting and challenging is a main cost factor in the design and maintenance of games. Dynamic difficulty adjustments (DDA) can successfully tune challenge levels to player abilities, but when implemented with classic heuristic parameter tuning (HPT) often turns out to be very noticeable, e.g. as "rubber-banding". Deep learning techniques can be employed for deep player behavior modeling (DPBM), enabling more complex adaptivity, but effects over frequent and longer-lasting game engagements, as well as how it compares to HPT has not been empirically investigated. We present a situated study of the effects of DDA via DPBM as compared to HPT on intrinsic motivation, perceived challenge and player motivation in a real-world MMORPG. The results indicate that DPBM can lead to significant improvements in intrinsic motivation and players prefer game experience episodes featuring DPBM over experience episodes with classic difficulty management. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Many online games suffer when players drop off due to lost connections or quitting prematurely, which leads to match terminations or game-play imbalances. While rule-based outcome evaluations or substitutions with bots are frequently used to mitigate such disruptions, these techniques are often perceived as unsatisfactory. Deep learning methods have successfully been used in deep player behavior modelling (DPBM) to produce non-player characters or bots which show more complex behavior patterns than those modelled using traditional AI techniques. Motivated by these findings, we present an investigation of the player-perceived awareness, believability and representativeness, when substituting disconnected players with DPBM agents in an online-multiplayer action game. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes indicate that DPBM agent substitutes perform similarly to human players and that players were unable to detect substitutions. Notably, players were in fact able to detect substitution with agents driven by more traditional heuristics. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (VR) evaluations and user studies. However, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to VR experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. Administering questionnaires in VR (inVRQs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. This is based on the intuitive notion that inVRQs may ease participation, reduce the Break in Presence (BIP) and avoid biases. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the VR experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. In a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a VR shooter with two different levels of immersion. The users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of VR. Our results indicate a reduced BIP for the employed inVRQ without affecting the self-reported player experience. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (VR) user studies. Transitioning from virtuality to reality for giving self-reports on VR experiences can lead to systematic biases. VR allows to embed questionnaires into the virtual environment which may ease participation and avoid biases. To provide a cohesive picture of methods and design choices for questionnaires in VR (inVRQ), we discuss 15 inVRQ studies from the literature and present a survey with 67 VR experts from academia and industry. Based on the outcomes, we conducted two user studies in which we tested different presentation and interaction methods of inVRQs and evaluated the usability and practicality of our design. We observed comparable completion times between inVRQs and questionnaires outside VR (nonVRQs) with higher enjoyment but lower usability for \inVRQs. These findings advocate the application of inVRQs and provide an overview of methods and considerations that lay the groundwork for inVRQ design. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={While face gesture input has been proposed by researchers, the issue of practical gestures remains unsolved. We present the first comprehensive investigation of user-defined face gestures as an augmented input modality. Based on a focus group discussion, we developed three sets of tasks, where we asked participants to spontaneously produce face gestures to complete these tasks. We report our findings of a user study and discuss the user preference of face gestures. The results inform the development of future interaction systems utilizing face gestures. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

abstract={During surgery, the surgeons often need to interact with the 2D radiological images. Due to sterility, surgeons are unable to interact with the system and depend on duty assistant. However, communication with the substitute might be complicated and error-prone if the operators and the surgeons do not have an equal level of communication skills which might interrupt the workflow. To get rid of the dependency on substitute operator, two hands-free modalities i.e. voice and foot- based interactions have been analyzed and investigated for the surgeon to interact with 2D images. To feel like a real Operation Theatre, the Virtual Reality environment has been designed, where the hands-free modalities are deployed. 16 participants had evaluated the interaction systems. To analysis, the system usability, the qualitative and quantitative studies have been considered. Our finding indicates that both systems reached general usability rating. Wherein the observation indicated that, the voice command system is comfortable to use whereas foot- based interaction is more efficient. Nevertheless, for the short and longer interaction foot-based interaction is preferable than a voice command, however, for short interaction, voice command is more acceptable. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Outsourcing effortful problems as microtasks has been successfully implemented by various human computation serious games or GWAP. Still, most of the academic approaches validate their results by conducting laboratory studies. While these have the potential to assess proposed techniques thoroughly with respect to quantitative and qualitative measures, they are prone to the often underestimated experimenter bias. In a large-scale field study (n = 713), we collect practically relevant empirical data about the quality of player behavior in a human computation serious game and classify the results as useful, insufficient or deliberately disruptive executions. Due to the drastic proportion of disruptive behavior (20.2%), we particularize explanations for this kind of behavior and discuss counteracting measurements. © 2019 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating enjoyment and engagement in video games. In recent years, various approaches have been introduced by the industry to raise motivation of players. One of the most prominent methods in modern games comes in the form of Achievements which are defined as optional meta-objectives that players can obtain by fulfilling tasks in the game. However, Achievements are designed uniformly regardless of the player’s personality, play style or general preferences. Therefore, individual differences between players are ignored which can diminish the motivational impact of Achievements. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the design of adaptive Achievements based on specific archetypes extracted from the BrainHex player typology. For the validation of this approach, we developed a simple Action-RPG which included adaptive Achievements. In a comparative study (n=28) we found that adaptation of Achievements leads to an increase of motivational aspects such as perceived effort/importance and sense of reward & individualization. © 2019 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Uninformed actions in privacy and security settings of mobile devices might cause data leaks. In many occasions, users may not be aware of such issues due to lack of knowledge on the topic. To raise interest and awareness towards this issue, extra effort might be needed. Game-based learning has proven to be an effective approach in terms of motivation and promotion of understanding. Humour is also considered to have the ability to create a positive attitude to the subject matter and reduce anxiety. To examine the interplay of games and humor, we developed What Could Go Wrong, a humorous decision-making game that helps users to better understand the consequences of applying security changes on a mobile device. We conducted a preliminary study comparing the game to two more models (a serious animated video and a humorous animated video), to analyze its impact on user’s motivation as well as raising awareness of the topic. Our user study (n = 21) shows that the game-based approach is more successful in engaging and raising awareness. © 2019 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Controlling a virtual character with your free hands is a useful task for many 3D applications such as games, computer puppetry, or emerging virtual reality applications. So far, only specialist controls have been established in the animation industry. Yet little is known about novices mental models for character control, a key to designing widely usable natural and expressive interfaces. To this end we conducted a gesture elicitation study with twelve participants performing mid-air gestures for thirteen given character motions. The mental models observed fall into two distinct categories: 1) external manipulation of an imagined physical puppet and 2) the gesturing hands embodying the motion of the virtual body part being “controlled”. The employed mental model determined hand posture and the mental transformation from gesture to character motion. We present and discuss a gesture set that can inform virtual puppetry interfaces for various application domains. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={Granting permissions in different contexts to applications on mobile devices might pose a direct threat to the users’ security and privacy by granting access to sensitive information. Although, Android permission dialogues already provide information about possible dangerous permissions, users might still not be aware of the consequences. Therefore, appropriate solutions for empowering users and raising awareness should be examined. As gamified applications can motivate players to learn more about rather uninteresting areas, we investigate the potential in the context of mobile security. We developed the gameful application Make my phone secure! for learning how to grant and change permissions. The game presents the Android menu in a playful and explanatory environment. To analyze possible learning effects of the application, we conducted an empirical study, comparing the game and two more basic variants (one with a simple Android menu and one menu enriched with hints concerning the permissions). The lab study (n = 18) showed that all three variants could increase the participants’ awareness significantly. However, the game was perceived as the most fun variant and provided more informative content than the common menu structures. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Finding and maintaining the right level of challenge with respect to the individual abilities of players has long been in the focus of game user research (GUR) and game development (GD). The right difficulty balance is usually considered a prerequisite for motivation and a good player experience. Dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) aims to tailor difficulty balance to individual players, but most deployments are limited to heuristically adjusting a small number of high-level difficulty parameters and require manual tuning over iterative development steps. Informing both GUR and GD, we compare an approach based on deep player behavior models which are trained automatically to match a given player and can encode complex behaviors to more traditional strategies for determining non-player character actions. Our findings indicate that deep learning has great potential in DDA. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Previsualization (previs) is an essential phase in the visual design process of narrative media such as film, animation, and stage plays. In digital previs complex 3D tools are used that are not specifically designed for the previs process making it hard to use for creative persons without much technical knowledge. To enable building dedicated previs software, we analyze the tasks performed in digital previs based on interviews with domain experts. In order to support creative persons in their previs work we propose the use of natural user interfaces and discuss which are suited for the specific previs tasks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Malicious Android applications can obtain user's private data and silently send it to a server. Android permissions are currently not sufficient enough to ensure the security of users' sensitive information. For a sufficient permission model it is important to account the target of the outgoing data flow. On the other hand, permission dialogues often contain relevant information, but most of the users generally do not understand the implications or the visualization fails to guide the user attention to it. It is important to empower users by providing applications that show them who can access their private data and who might send this data to the outside. In order to raise user awareness considering Android permissions, we developed HappyPermi, an application that visualizes which user information is accessible by the granted permissions. Our evaluation (n = 20) shows that most users are not aware of the sensitive data that their installed applications have access to. Our results suggest how different users feel about accessing their sensitive data when they are aware of its outgoing destinations. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Professionals in domains like film, theater, or architecture often rely on physical models to visualize spaces. With virtual reality (VR) new tools are available providing immersive experiences with correct perceptions of depth and scale. However, these lack the tangibility of physical models. Using tangible objects in VR can close this gap but creates the challenges of producing suitable objects and interacting with them with only the virtual objects visible. This work addresses these challenges by evaluating tangibles with three haptic fidelities: equal disc-shaped tangibles for all virtual objects, Lego-built tangibles, and 3D-printed tangibles resembling the virtual shapes. We present results from a comparative study on immersion, performance, and intuitive interaction and interviews with domain experts. The results show that 3D-printed objects perform best, but Lego offers a good trade-off between fast creation of tangibles and sufficient fidelity. The experts rate our approach as useful and would use all three versions. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Medical images contain important information for diagnosis and preoperative planning in modern medicine. Interacting with these images still happens mostly with a mouse, abstract gestures or handles. In a focus group with five surgeons, we evaluate the possibilities of 3D printed organ models for interaction in VR for the use case of surgery planning. The surgeons rate the approach as highly useful and highlighted the advantage of easier grasping the space relations, which would greatly improve the planning phase of surgery. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We present VRBox-an interactive sandbox for playful and immersive terraforming that combines the approach of augmented sandboxes with virtual reality technology and mid-air gestures. Our interactive demonstration offers a virtual reality (VR) environment containing a landscape, which the user designs via interacting with real sand while wearing a VR head-mounted display (HMD). Whereas real sandboxes have been used with augmented reality before, our approach using sand in VR offers novel and original interactive features such as exploring the sand landscape from a first person perspective. In this demo, users can experience our VR-sandbox system consisting of a box with sand, multiple Kinect depth sensing, an HMD, and hand tracking, as well as an interactive world simulation. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={We propose an approach to facilitate adjustable grip for object interaction in virtual reality. It enables the user to handle objects with loose and firm grip using conventional controllers. Pivotal design properties were identified and evaluated in a qualitative pilot study. Two revised interaction designs with variable grip were compared to the status quo of invariable grip in a quantitative study. The users performed placing actions with all interaction modes. Performance, clutching, task load, and usability were measured. While the handling time increased slightly using variable grip, the usability score was significantly higher. No substantial differences were measured in positioning accuracy. The results lead to the conclusion that variable grip can be useful and improve realism depending on tasks, goals, and user preference. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The concept of providing power-ups and other rewards to players in sedentary gaming sessions based on prior engagement in beneficial activities, such as exercising, has recently been explored under the term pervasive accumulated context exergames (PACE). Such games have less special requirements and may appeal to a broader audience than regular exergames. However, so far, little is known about the motivational potential and the impact on the targeted beneficial outcomes. To advance research on the potential of asynchronously linking physical exercises to games, we provide a discussion of related work and present a design space for further systematic exploration. Additionally, we present a study which indicates that linked rewards in gaming after an exercise session can lead to motivational benefits and to increased physical activity, when compared to playing a game that does not include such explicitly linked rewards after an exercise session. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle is a major contributor to many chronic afflictions in modern society. Objective study and monitoring to gain an accurate understanding of situated sedentary behavior, for example when at home, present considerable challenges, e.g. regarding ecological validity. Non-intrusive monitoring based on Wi-Fi signals provides a new way to gain insights into populations that are at risk of the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle, or who are already in functional rehabilitation. In this paper we describe a tracking technology for everyday activities that consists of two parts: (1) recognizing general physical activity, as well as the activities of common classes; and (2) measuring the statistical duration of these recognized categories. Employing common commercial Wi-Fi equipment, we performed validation studies in a typical noisy family home environment, achieving the following key results: (1) a recognition rate of the general presence of physical activity of 99.05%, an average recognition rate of 92% when detecting four common classes of activities; and (2) Kappa coefficient analysis to evaluate the consistency of the statistical duration of the automatic activity detection based on Wi-Fi signals and manually coded activity detection based on camera recordings. The coefficient for the presence of general physical activity of.93 and the average consistency coefficient of the classified activity categories of.72 suggest a high reliability of the automatic detection outcomes. This work aims to support both research and interventions for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, by establishing new technologies and methods for observing everyday functional activities that are crucial for individual independent living and well-being. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Procedural content generation (PCG) techniques have become increasingly established over the years in the context of video games. In terms of generating level layouts, PCG has proven to be a cost-efficient alternative to handcrafted design processes. However, previous research is mostly concerned with singleplayer experiences only. Since multiplayer games differ strongly in regards to the requirements that have to be met by map layouts, we addressed the following question: Which PCG approaches are suited best to ensure qualities relevant in the area of level creation for competitive multiplayer platform games? We conclude that a combination of constructive and grammar-based methods serves as a viable solution. We developed a PCG prototype which was integrated into a competitive platform game. Results of a user study indicate that a constructive-grammar PCG algorithm can be used to generate map layouts that are perceived to be fun and compelling. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, 2019.},

abstract={The design of cooperative games is challenging due to the requirements of cooperation between the players. The major need of the design is to provide an environment that enables players to achieve the game goal in a cooperative fashion. The game premise which is the story behind the game is one of the dramatic elements and impacts the engagement of players. In this paper, we investigate the effect of game premise on the engagement of the players and the cooperation between the players. Hence, to understand this effect, we developed three versions of the Pandemic game with three premises namely positive, negative, and neutral. Using these game versions, we conducted an experiment to see how game premise affects the player experience. The results show that premise can significantly influence the players’ intrinsic motivation, the connection with the game and the cooperation strategies. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, 2019.},

abstract={We developed a multi-touch interface for the citizen science video game Foldit, in which players manipulate 3D protein structures, and compared multi-touch and mouse interfaces in a 41-subject user study. We found that participants performed similarly in both interfaces and did not have an overall preference for either interface. However, results indicate that for tasks involving guided movement to dock protein parts, subjects using the multi-touch interface completed tasks more accurately with fewer moves, and reported higher attention and spatial presence. For tasks involving direct selection and dragging of points, subjects using the mouse interface performed fewer camera adjustments. © 2019, Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati.},

abstract={While manipulatives have played an important role in children's mathematics development for decades, employing tangible objects together with digital systems in the classroom has been rarely explored yet. In a transdisciplinary research project with computer scientists, mathematics educators and a textbook publisher, we investigate the potentials of using tangible user interfaces for algebra learning and develop as well as evaluate a scalable system for different use cases. In this paper, we present design implications for tangible user interfaces for algebra learning that were derived from a comprehensive feld study in a grade 9 classroom and an expert study with textbook authors, who also are teachers. Furthermore, we present and discuss the resulting system design. © 2011-2019 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH.},

abstract={This paper describes the design and evaluation process of a location-based serious game in a heritage awareness context. Conveying knowledge regarding tangible cultural heritage with the help of video games is a well-established concept. Though many applications in this domain have proven to be effective, they always rely on restrictions regarding time, place and usage of specific hardware. In contrast to previous approaches, we have developed Memorial Quest, a serious game with the objective to convey knowledge regarding cultural heritage objects accessible without aforementioned constraints. We examined educational effects by conducting a user study (n = 40) in which we compared our game to a common learning method in cultural heritage. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that learning effects were significantly larger when playing the game instead of perceiving the same contents in a traditional way. With the help of questionnaires and qualitative data, we identified possible flaws and elaborated potential improvements for future iterations. © 2018 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Due to a steady increase in popularity, player demands for video game content are growing to an extent at which consistency and novelty in challenges are hard to attain. Problems in balancing and error-coping accumulate. To tackle these challenges, we introduce deep player behavior models, applying machine learning techniques to individual, atomic decision-making strategies. We discuss their potential application in personalized challenges, autonomous game testing, human agent substitution, and online crime detection. Results from a pilot study that was carried out with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Lineage II depict a benchmark between hidden markov models, decision trees, and deep learning. Data analysis and individual reports indicate that deep learning can be employed to provide adequate models of individual player behavior with high accuracy for predicting skill-use and a high correlation in recreating strategies from previously recorded data.

abstract={Augmented sandboxes have been used as playful and educative tools to create, explore and understand complex models. However, current solutions lack interactive capabilities, missing more immersive experiences such as exploring the sand landscape from a first person perspective. We extend the interaction space of augmented sandboxes into virtual reality (VR) to offer a VR-environment that contains a landscape, which the user designs via interacting with real sand while wearing a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). In this paper, we present our current VR-sandbox system consisting of a box with sand, triple Kinect depth sensing, a virtual reality HMD, and hand tracking, as well as an interactive world simulation use case for exploration and evaluation. Our work explores the important and timely topics how to integrate rich haptic interaction with natural materials into VR and how to track and present real physical materials in VR. In a qualitative evaluation with nine experts from computer graphics, game design, and didactics we identified potentials, limitations as well as future application scenarios.

abstract={Room-scale mapping facilitates natural locomotion in virtual reality (VR), but it creates a problem when encountering virtual walls. In traditional video games, player avatars can simply be prevented from moving through walls. This is not possible in VR with room-scale mapping due to the lack of physical boundaries. Game design is either limited by avoiding walls, or the players might ignore them, which endangers the immersion and the overall game experience. To prevent players from walking through walls, we propose a combination of auditory, visual, and vibrotactile feedback for wall collisions. This solution can be implemented with standard game engine features, does not require any additional hardware or sensors, and is independent of game concept and narrative. A between-group study with 46 participants showed that a large majority of players without the feedback did pass through virtual walls, while 87% of the participants with the feedback refrained from walking through walls. The study found no notable differences in game experience. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Previsualization (previs) is an essential phase in the design process of narrative media such as film, animation, and stage plays. Digital previs can involve complex technical tasks, e.g. 3D scene creation, animation, and camera work, which require trained skills that are not available to all personnel involved in creative decisions for the production. Interaction techniques such as virtual reality (VR) enable users to interact with 3D content in a natural way compared to classical 2D interfaces. As a first step, we developed VR based prototypes and performed an exploratory user study to evaluate how non-technical professionals from the film, animation, and theater domain assess the use of VR for previs. Our results show that users were able to interact with complex 3D scenes after a short phase of familiarization and rated VR for previs as useful for their professional work.

abstract={One fundamental way how players relate to games is through the avatar they are represented by. In this work, we explore the impact of real-time adjustment of avatar appearance (visual body weight) on player motivation in exergames. Our results draw a mixed picture: while qualitative findings show that players were aware of adaptations, quantitative results do not demonstrate significant differences in player motivation. Instead, observations suggest that players leveraged the mechanic to develop their own meta-game, an effect that needs to be considered when designing mechanics that aim to improve player motivation in exergaming settings. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The general promise of employing the motivational power of games for serious purposes, such as performing physiotherapy exercises, is well-established. However, game user research discusses both the approach of gamification, i.e. adding game-elements on to a task-focused application and of serious games, i.e. injecting task-focused elements into a more fully-fledged game. There is a surprising lack of empirical work that contrasts both approaches. We present both a casually gamified application and a serious game with purpose-driven mechanics that provide different fron-tends to the same underlying digital health application. This application aims at supporting physiotherapy sessions for chronic lower-back afflictions. Results from an explorative pre-study contrasting both approaches indicate a clear preference for the serious game version, capturing higher perceived motivational components (autonomy and relatedness), as well as higher immersion and flow relative to the gamified version.

abstract={Medical images and navigation systems support physicians during needle-based interventions. As the information is primarily displayed on monitors, the physician’s attention is drawn away from the patient’s body. To address this issue, we explore the additional use of a vibration wristband that directs the movements for needle-based operations via different vibration patterns on the operator’s arm. We conducted a first user study comparing the combination of tactile and visual guidance versus visual-only feedback with 12 participants to investigate the general feasibility. Our results show that task times, usability scores, cognitive load, and accuracy are comparable for both conditions suggesting that vibration feedback is generally suitable for medical navigation tasks and warranting further iteration and research in this direction.

abstract={Needle-guiding templates are used for a variety of minimally invasive medical interventions. While physically supporting needle placement with a grid of holes, they lack integrated information where needles need to be inserted. Physicians must manually determine the correct holes based on the output of planning software - a workflow that is error-prone and lengthy. We address these issues by embedding a display into the template using electroluminescence (EL) screen printing. The EL display is connected to planning software and illuminates the correct hole. In an empirical evaluation with physicians and researchers from the medical domain, we compare the illuminated against the conventional template as used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided prostate biopsies. Our results show that the EL display significantly improves task completion time by 51 %, task load by 47 % and usability by 30 %. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={During interventions, surgeons often need to review medical imaging data, e.g., CT scans. Usually, surgeons need to rely on an assistant to browse the images because of sterility requirements. Communication with a substitute operator is tedious and error-prone if the operator does not have an equal level of professional experience and might interrupt the workflow. We present a sensor-integrated shoe allowing surgeons to browse and manipulate 2D medical image data by foot movement. It is portable and wearable. The shoe uses an optical sensor taken from an off-the-shelf computer mouse for tracking the foot movements and an additional micro-switch to turn it on or off. We evaluated the performance of the shoe interface against a control condition with assistant together with ten surgeons in an empirical user study. Our results provide first indications for the effectiveness of a shoe interface in this application area. Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Serious video games represent an immersive way of learning, providing an interaction between learning and game-play. Serious games have shown to be motivational and train the player to acquire certain skills. However, designers should find a balance between pedagogical goals and game-mechanics. Recent investigations show the learning benefits that players obtain by playing music-video games and how these games can support players to improve their musical skills due to embodied music cognition. In the current study, we develop a music-video game to improve the pitch recognition of players. We use the LM-GM model to assess the design of the video game. Moreover, a pilot case study was conducted where the participants performed the video game and answered a Game Experience Questionnaire. Thus, we analyzed the player experience and preliminary results display a relation between learning and game-play. Nevertheless, more studies are needed for appraising the learning effects. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={As in many other research areas the material sciences produce vast amounts of experimental data. The corresponding findings are then published, albeit the data remains in heterogeneous formats within institutes and is neither shared nor reused by the scientific community. To address this issue we have developed and deployed a scientific data management environment for the material sciences at various test facilities. Unlike other systems this one explicitly models every facet of the experiment and the materials used therein - thereby supporting the initial design of the experiment, its execution and the ensuing results. Consequently, the collection of the structured data becomes an integral part of the research workflow rather than a post hoc nuisance. In this paper we report on an empirical study that was performed to test the effects of a paradigm change in the data model to align it better with the actual scientific practice at hand. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={This workshop position paper presents ongoing research on using smart tangible objects for algebra learning. While mathematical manipulatives have played an important role in children's mathematics development for decades, employing tangible objects in the classroom has been rarely explored yet. In our work, we investigate the potentials of using smart objects for algebra learning. Our smart tiles are based on traditional algebra tiles, passive mathematical manipulatives used in many schools in Northern America, and we currently extend these by 1.) multimodal input and output capabilities, 2.) dynamic constraints and 3.) adaptivity and feedback. In this paper, we give an overview on the overall system concept, the interaction with the tangible objects and their current design, as well as on the potentials of actuated smart objects for future interaction.

abstract={Instructions for physical exercises leave many details underspecified that are taken for granted and inferred by the intended reader. For certain applications, such as generating virtual action visualizations from such textual instructions, advanced text processing is needed, requiring interpretation of both implicit and explicit information. This work presents an ontology that can support the semantic analysis of such instructions in order to support the identification of matching action constructs. The proposed ontology lays down a hierarchical structure following the human body structure along with various type of movement restrictions. This facilitates flexible yet adequate representations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={With ICARUS, we introduce a framework for autonomous video game playing, testing, and bug reporting. We report on the design rationale, the practical implementation, and its use in game development industry projects. With ICARUS, we introduce a framework for autonomous video game playing, testing, and bug reporting. We report on the design rationale, the practical implementation, and its use in game development industry projects. The underlying solving mechanic is based on discrete reinforcement learning in a dualistic fashion, encompassing volatile short-term memory as well as persistent long-term memory that spans across distinct game iterations. In combination with heuristics that reduce the search space and the possibility to employ pre-defined situation-dependent action choices, the system manages to traverse complete playthrough iterations in roughly the same amount of time that a professional game tester requires for a speedrun. The ICARUS project was developed at Daedalic Entertainment. The software can be used to generically run all adventure games built with the popular Visionaire Engine [6] and is currently used for evaluating daily builds, for large-scale hardware compatibility and performance tests, as well as for semi-supervised quality assurance playthroughs. The supplementary video depicts real-time solving with active control and observation via a web control panel. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Building 3D scenes for games can be a difficult task, especially for beginners and other non-experts wanting to contribute their own ideas in an easy way. Tools for map or world creation are often complex to understand and use, don't support the creative process of building a scene, and decouple design from player experience. To overcome these problems, we present a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game for level creation using game mechanics for all tasks, making the process more easy and enjoyable while also providing direct experience of the work from a player's point of view. We evaluated our approach in a preliminary study where we compared our game to a simplified version of the Unity editor, representing generic world building tools, and found that users enjoy the our game, find it more usable, and feel more creative. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Landmark-based navigation systems have proven benefits relative to traditional turn-by-turn systems that use street names and distances. However, one obstacle to the implementation of landmark-based navigation systems is the complex challenge of selecting salient local landmarks at each decision point for each user. In this paper, we present Pharos, a novel system that extends turn-by-turn navigation instructions using a single global landmark (e.g. the Eiffel Tower, the Burj Khalifa, municipal TV towers) rather than multiple, hard-to-select local landmarks. We first show that our approach is feasible in a large number of cities around the world through the use of computer vision to select global landmarks. We then present the results of a study demonstrating that by including global landmarks in navigation instructions, users navigate more confidently and build a more accurate mental map of the navigated area than using turn-by-turn instructions.},

abstract={Purpose : Surgical navigation systems rely on a monitor placed in the operating room to relay information. Optimal monitor placement can be challenging in crowded rooms, and it is often not possible to place the monitor directly beside the situs. The operator must split attention between the navigation system and the situs. We present an approach for needle-based interventions to provide navigational feedback directly on the instrument and close to the situs by mounting a small display onto the needle. Methods : By mounting a small and lightweight smartwatch display directly onto the instrument, we are able to provide navigational guidance close to the situs and directly in the operator’s field of view, thereby reducing the need to switch the focus of view between the situs and the navigation system. We devise a specific variant of the established crosshair metaphor suitable for the very limited screen space. We conduct an empirical user study comparing our approach to using a monitor and a combination of both. Results : Results from the empirical user study show significant benefits for cognitive load, user preference, and general usability for the instrument-mounted display, while achieving the same level of performance in terms of time and accuracy compared to using a monitor. Conclusion : We successfully demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and potential benefits. With ongoing technological advancements, instrument-mounted displays might complement standard monitor setups for surgical navigation in order to lower cognitive demands and for improved usability of such systems. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Extracting large body movement dataset from textual instruction could be useful for serious games for health to learning by demonstration in robotics. The interpretation of instructions for the automatic generation of the corresponding motions (e.g. exercises) and the validation of these movements are difficult tasks. In this article we analyzed a step towards achieving automated extraction of motions from textual instruction of physical exercise. To achieve this, we have recorded 36 different exercises using a XSENS motion suit. Using the XSENS data we have developed one automated physical exercise engine with three different modes. In this engine all exercises are generated in skeleton mode. Out of these three mode, in first mode it is limited to the mentioned exercises in the application. In second mode user can generate any combination of exercise (upto four) of the mentioned exercises. And in the last mode user can generate any exercise using text input or uploading instruction sheet to the system. We are still working on the third mode, which is not fully efficient now. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Many people suffer from a decline in their motor abilities and their sense of balance. Such complications are often related to a sedentary life style or specific illnesses. Physiotherapy can help with improving the situation, however, a lack of motivation to perform repetitive exercises, as well as achieving an adequate quality of execution and level of exertion are considerable challenges. Motion-based games for health (MGH) can motivate patients and support them in performing such exercises. But the important interaction between therapists and patients is often not sufficiently considered in MGH design and therapists' means for intervention and adjustment of such games are limited. We integrate local live direction into MGH, enabling simultaneous adjustments by the therapist while the patient is playing. We evaluated our prototype with 9 therapists, collecting feedback on usability, user experience, and practical applicability. Our results show that the concept was received well, as evidenced by excellent quantitative usability ratings and very positive qualitative feedback.

abstract={Computer-assisted surgery has pervaded the operating room (OR). While display and imaging technologies advance rapidly, keyboard and mouse are still the dominant input devices, even though they cause sterility problems. We present an interactive virtual operating room (IVOR), intended as a tool to develop and study interaction methods for the OR, and two novel touch-free interaction techniques using hand and foot gestures. All was developed and evaluated with 20 surgeons. The results show that our techniques can be used with minimal learning time and no significant differences regarding completion time and usability compared to the control condition relying on verbal instruction of an assistant. Furthermore, IVOR as a tool was well received by the surgeons, although they had no prior experience with virtual reality. This confirms IVOR is an effective tool for user-centered design and evaluation, providing a portable, yet realistic substitution for a real OR for early evaluations.

abstract={We introduce WatchThru, an interactive method for extended wrist-worn display on commercially-available smartwatches. To address the limited visual and interaction space, WatchThru expands the device into 3D through a transparent display. This enables novel interactions that leverage and extend smartwatch glanceability. We describe three novel interaction techniques, Pop-up Visuals, Second Perspective and Peek-through, and discuss how they can complement interaction on current devices. We also describe two types of prototypes that helped us to explore standalone interactions, as well as, proof-of-concept AR interfaces using our platform.

abstract={Physical exercise instruction sheets are difficult to understand. In general, considerable information is hidden in these types of instruction sheets, which also makes them difficult for machines to understand. Major missing information types include the source and destination location of a human movement. Here we present a Bayesian network to extract the implicit or missing information from typical exercise instruction sheets. We proposed two different kind of Bayesian networks which consists of three and four variables respectively. The network with three variable are designed to for single exercise instruction with single action or pose and the other one designed for single or multiple sentence with two actions or poses. The conditional probability table (CPT) is the backbone of the Bayesian network. At the start, the CPT is updated from our physical exercise instruction sheet corpus (PEISC). Keeping the Action and Bodypart fixed, we have developed our CPT using a unique approach, i.e., crowdsourcing, where we have developed a CPT update system using 13 different exercises consisting of 44 different exercise videos. Using this system based on the rating of a participant of the video the specific variable of that CPT is updated automatically in the Bayesian network. We also updated the Action variable, which consists of 14 different values (action verbs) using crowdsourcing with a human computation approach. © CTU FTS 2017.},

abstract={Locomotion in virtual reality (VR) remains challenging due to limitations of common input methods. Sedentary input devices may endanger immersion, real-to-virtual world perception dissonance can lead to simulator sickness, and physical input devices such as framed walking dishes are often complex and expensive. We present a low-cost, easy to use, easy to manufacture, and easily portable device for locomotion in VR based on a hoverboard metaphor. Building on related work and our own iterative VR locomotion system designs we hypothesize that hoverboarding can provide a compelling and intuitive method for short- and long-distance locomotion in VR with a potential to reduce simulator sickness due to consistent and stable locomotion that corresponds well to the physical proprioception of the users while navigating VR. We discuss design iterations of our device prototypes, promising results from an early explorative evaluation, as well as ongoing continued work. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

abstract={People tend to collect more and more data, this is especially true for images on mobile devices. Tagging images is a good way to sort such collections. While automatic tagging systems are often focused on the content, such as objects or persons in the image, manual annotations are very important to describe the context of an image. Often especially emotions are important, e.g., when a person reflects a situation, shows images from a very personal collection to others, or when using images to illustrate presentations. Unfortunately, manual annotation is often very boring and users are not very motivated to do so. While there are many approaches to motivate people to annotate data in a conventional way, none of them has focused on emotions. In this poster abstract, we present EmoWheel; an innovative interface to annotate images with emotional tags. We conducted a user study with 18 participants. Results show that the EmoWheel can enhance the motivation to annotate images.},

abstract={Providing pedestrian navigation instructions on small screens is a challenging task due to limited screen space. As image-based approaches for navigation have been successfully proven to outperform map-based navigation on mobile devices, we propose to bring image-based navigation to smartwatches. We contribute a straightforward pipeline to easily create image-based indoor navigation instructions that allow users to freely navigate in indoor environments without any localization infrastructure and with minimal user input on the smartwatch. In a user study, we show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the art application in terms of task completion time, perceived task load and perceived usability. In addition, we did not find an indication that there is a need to provide explicit directional instructions for image-based navigation on small screens. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Matching game difficulty to player ability is a crucial step toward a rewarding player experience, yet making difficulty adjustments that are effective yet unobtrusive can be challenging. This paper examines the impact of automatic and player-initiated difficulty adjustment on player experience through two studies. In the first study, 40 participants played the casual game THYFTHYF either in motion-based or sedentary mode, using menu-based, embedded, or automatic difficulty adjustment. In the second study, we created an adapted version of the commercially available game fl0w to allow us to carry out a more focused study of sedentary casual play. Results from both studies demonstrate that the type of difficulty adjustment has an impact on perceived autonomy, but other player experience measures were not affected as expected. Our findings suggest that most players express a preference for manual difficulty choices, but that overall game experience was not notably impacted by automated difficulty adjustments.},

abstract={Digital motion-based games with affordable tracking methods for full body tracking allow users to play computer games controlled with body movements. They can be used as so called exergames, combining exercises and games. Exergames have three major benefits: (1) they can raise motivation for doing exercises through immersive interactive game play; (2) they can give users feedback regarding physiologically beneficial movements and aggregate performance over time; (3) they can be adapted to the individual user. This is a great chance, but also a great challenge in the development of exergames. When employing exergames as games for health, e.g. in physiotherapy, many patients (players) display individual predispositions and abilities with temporal variations. Anticipating and adapting to physical ability and individual training goals on various timescales require subtle mechanisms that capture differences for individual users. We discuss and analyze adaptivity requirements and implementation approaches for anticipatory techniques in this context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Modern technology gives surgeons the possibility to plan operations using complex 3D information tools providing data integration, analysis and visualization. However, in the operating room, most of the tools are not at hand. It might be useful to access the data and to visualize certain surgical procedures during the actual surgery. We investigate such situations and look for novel solutions for intra-operative support for surgeons to access 3D information: what they need, when they need it. We integrate medical image processing, cognitive modeling and human- computer interaction in order to anticipate the surgeons’ needs. We address three issues for developing such systems: how to identify what information the surgeon needs; how to adapt pre- and intra-procedure information to the surgical situation; how to present the relevant information to the surgeon. This paper presents the vision and preliminary results of a collaborative research project. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Strong adaptability is a major requirement and challenge in the physiotherapeutic use of motion-based games for health. For adaptation tool development, tablets are a promising platform due to their similarity in affordance compared to traditional clipboards. In a comparative study, we examined three different input modalities on the tablet that allow for configuring joint angles: direct-touch, classic interface components (e.g. buttons and sliders), and a combination of both. While direct touch emerged as the least preferable modality, the results highlight the benefits of the combination of direct-touch and classic interface components as the most accessible modality for configuring joint angle ranges. Furthermore, the importance of configuring joint angles along three distinct axes and the interesting use-case of configuration tools as communication support emerged. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Map applications for smartwatches present new challenges in cartography, a domain in which large display sizes have significant advantages. In this paper, we introduce StripeMaps, a system that adapts the mobile web design technique of linearization for displaying maps on the small screens of smartwatches. Just as web designers simplify multiple column desktop websites into a single column for easier navigation on mobile devices, StripeMaps transforms any two-dimensional route map into a one-dimensional "stripe". Through a user study, we show that this simplification allows StripeMaps to outperform both traditional mobile map interfaces and turn-by-turn directions for pedestrian navigation using smartwatches. In addition to introducing StripeMaps, this paper also has a secondary contribution. It contains the first empirical comparison of different approaches for pedestrian smartwatch navigation and illuminates their pros and cons. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we assess users' emotional experiences of real soap bubbles as input material in an interactive game. We designed a game that can be controlled via soap bubbles. In a user study we compared playing the game with bubbles versus with transparent plastic spheres as handles for input. We collected data on users' emotions and user experience by using the PANAS-X and the User Experience Questionnaire as well as by observing the participants during the interaction sessions. The study shows that the interaction with real bubbles is more playful and causes more surprise when used for the first time in a digital game. © 2015, Weisbecker, Burmester, Schmidt.},

abstract={Exergames are increasingly considered as an exercise instruction modality in health applications. Studies are typically conducted in non-situated contexts and capture short- Term effects. We present first results from a medium-scale study conducted over the course of 5 weeks and integrated into a normal rehabilitation program. The study features three groups, comparing manually adjustable exergames with the identical games in adaptive versions and manual physiotherapy interventions without games. The results indicate that the exergames and traditional therapy are comparable regarding measures of competence and enjoy- ment, while exergames led to significantly higher scores for autonomy, presence, and in a functional reach test. With traditional therapy, scores for tension-pressure and effort- importance were significantly higher. The initial results of the broader study presented in this paper deliver insights regarding motivational aspects of exergames and traditional therapy and point out which motivational aspects could be strengthened in future implementations. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Autonomous manipulation robots can be valuable AIDS as interactive agents in the home, yet it has proven extremely difficult to program their behavior. Imitation learning uses data on human demonstrations to build behavioral models for robots. In order to cover a wide range of action strategies, data from many individuals is needed. Acquiring such large amounts of data can be a challenge. Tools for data capturing in this domain must thus implement a good user experience. We propose to use human computation games in order to gather data on human manual behavior. We demonstrate the idea with a strategy game that is operated via a natural user interface. A comparison between using the game for action execution and demonstrating actions in a virtual environment shows that people interact longer and have a better experience when playing the game. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Availability of commodity gaming devices for bodily input has sparked new interest in serious games for rehabilitation and the treatment of age-related diseases. This leads to the idea of creating games for the daily use to prevent the age-related loss of certain abilities. In a qualitative in-depth field study, we visited senior participants at their homes over the course of three full days. During this time they played a selection of off-the-shelf games titles that included game controls that can be seen also as physical exercises. We discuss our qualitative findings and formulate design lessons to consider when developing games for older adults: favor progress over challenge, prevent overexertion, prevent health risks, decreased reaction times, design for adaptability, and prefer realistic scenarios and mechanics over fantasy settings. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Computer games are big business, which is also reflected in the growing interest in competitive gaming, the so-called electronic sports. Multi-player online battle arena games are among the most successful games in this regard. In order to execute complex team-based strategies, players take on very specific roles within a team. This paper investigates the applicability of supervised machine learning to classifying player behavior in terms of specific and commonly accepted but not formally well-defined roles within a team of players of the game Dota 2. We provide an in-depth discussion and novel approaches for constructing complex attributes from low-level data extracted from replay files. Using attribute evaluation techniques, we are able to reduce a larger set of candidate attributes down to a manageable number. Based on this resulting set of attributes, we compare and discuss the performance of a variety of supervised classification algorithms. Our results with a data set of 708 labeled players see logistic regression as the overall most stable and best performing classifier. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

abstract={Mobile multi-purpose devices such as smartphones are progressively replacing digital cameras; people use their smartphones as everyday companions and increasingly take pictures in their daily life. Tagging is a way to organize huge collections of photos but raises two challenges. First, tagging (especially on mobile devices) is a boring task. Second, remembering the assigned tags is important to find images with tags. We propose gamification for more entertaining tagging. Most gamification approaches use crowd-based assessments of good or bad tags, which is a good way to prevent cheating and to not assign improper tags. However, it is not appropriate for personal images because users don’t want to share every image with the crowd. We developed and evaluated two mobile apps with gamification elements to tag images, a single-player and a multiplayer app. While both variants were more entertaining than a simple tagging app, the single-player app helps users to remember significant more tags. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Understanding the impact of interaction mechanics on the user’s emotional state can aid in shaping the user experience. For eliciting the emotional state of a user, designers and researchers typically employ subjective or expert assessment. Yet these methods are typically applied after the user has finished the interaction, causing a delay between stimulus and assessment. Physiological measures potentially offer more reliable indication of a user’s affective state in real-time. We present an experiment to increase our understanding of the relation of certain stimuli and valence of induced emotions in games. For this we designed a simple game to induce negative and positive emotions in the player. The results show a high correspondence between our classification of participants’ physiological signals and subjective assessment. However, creating a clear causality between game elements and emotions is a daunting task, and our designs offer room for improvement. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

abstract={Design of and research on animation interfaces rarely uses methods and theory of human-computer-interaction (HCI). Graphical motion design interfaces are based on dated interaction paradigms, and novel procedures for capturing, processing and mapping motion are preoccupied with aspects of modeling and computation. Yet research in HCI has come far in understanding human cognition and motor skills and how to apply this understanding to interaction design. We propose an HCI perspective on computer animation that relates the state-of-the-art in motion design interfaces to the concepts and terminology of this field. The main contribution is a design space of animation interfaces. This conceptual framework aids relating strengths and weaknesses of established animation methods and techniques. We demonstrate how this interaction-centric approach can be put into practice in the development of a multi-touch animation system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper we present how to tag images automatically based on the image and sensor data from a mobile device. We developed a system that computes low-level tags using the image itself and meta data. Based on these tags and previous user tags we learn high-level tags. With a client-server-implementation we source out computational expensive algorithms to recommend the tags as fast as possible. We show what are the best feature extraction methods in combination with a machine learning technique to recommend good tags.},

abstract={Serious games became an object of research and development in the last decade. Using computer game technology for serious applications can be very beneficial for a variety of applications. In particular when it is about motivating people through gaming mechanisms, there is a great potential to use gaming technology and the psychological mechanisms that attract people to games for making them do activities that would otherwise either be not done or at least with much less enthusiasm. One such application is personal fitness. So called exergames aim at wrapping physical exercises into computer games. They range from rehabilitation programs to workout programs mimicking a personal trainer. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Game designers have to satisfy the needs of different player types. This paper presents a generalizable concept for switching between different play styles or genres without changing the basic game elements. As an example we employ specific combinations of parametrized game elements to emulate well-known genres: platformer, shooter, and puzzle games that can be switched at run-time by the player. We discuss first insights gained through a preliminary study. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Text entry on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets almost exclusively depends on using on-screen keyboards that base on touch interaction. Due to the often limited space available on the touchscreen, the keys are displayed very small and are therefore hard to hit, especially in mobile scenarios or with users that do not have perfect eyesight. In our work we utilize a feature of some smartphones where a user's finger is detected before it touches the screen. This hover detection is used to enlarge the area of the keyboard under the finger to make it more readable and easier to use. A first working prototype exists and will be evaluated in the near future.},

abstract={Studies in the field of pedestrian navigation have shown advantages of map–image combinations. While in a previous work, the map view was either replaced with an image view in predefined situations, or the user was required to manually switch between both views, we suggest to use a split screen displaying maps and images at the same time. We developed two variants, one employing panoramic images aligned to the mobile device's orientation and the other using simple photographs, and we evaluated both against manual switching in a field study. While none of the interfaces outperformed the other, results indicate advantages of panoramic images independent of manual switching or the split screen. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We present an experimental comparison of three kinesiatric exercise instruction modalities: a live human instructor (human), recorded video (video) and a virtual figure displayed next to the representation of the users' approximate skeleton (interactive). The results regarding user experience, preferences, and exercise accuracy indicate a preference for the human instructor across measures. A disparity exists between exercise accuracy and perceived ease of understanding when comparing the video with the interactive modality. Perception measures indicate a slight preference for the video modality, whilst performance data shows a significantly higher accuracy in the interactive condition. Our findings support the further investigation of digital interfaces to support physical therapy and rehabilitation as a cost-effective and potentially more efficiently customizable addition to traditional exercise instruction forms.},

The contributions of this work are threefold. First, it addresses the yet underexplored field of integrating context information beyond location and time into mobile tagging systems and folksonomies. Second, it suggests novel visualizations to explore tagged data and folksonomies beyond tag clouds and simple map representations on mobile phones. And third, it gives novel insights into supporting the embedded practices of a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) urban gardening community with interactive systems based on ethnographic fieldwork and participatory design. © 2013 Authors.},

abstract={Augmented reality is a way to enhance mobile games and can be easily implemented on today's powerful smartphones. Developers need to consider additional constraints when choosing the input method for such an AR game. We implemented three control methods for a mobile AR multiplayer fighting game using a virtual joystick, a touch interface and continuous crosshair tracking. We evaluated the effect of the control methods on the game experience with 43 participants and conducted a survey using a questionnaire for intuitive use (QUESI [1]) and individiual interviews. We found significant differences between two of the three implemented input methods, but in the interviews the test persons did not prefer the control method with the highest survey score. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={Exercise video games (exergames) can motivate players to be more physically active. However, most exergames are controlled by confined and predefined movements and do not promote long-term motivation. Well-funded commercial games often excel at long-term motivation, but are not operated with motion input. Exercise My Game (XMG) is a design framework for turning off-the-shelf action games into full-body motion-based games. Challenges with this approach involve finding mappings from control input to game-action, as well as blending active input feedback with the game's interface. XMG facilitates transforming well-produced, non-exercise video games into captivating exergames by structuring the design space and outlining game requirements. We illustrate XMG with the example of turning the popular first-person action game Portal 2 into the exergame Sportal. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the mobile gaming market and the steadily improved hardware of mobile phones enable developers to create complex and extensive 3D games on mobile phones. While most current casual games have simple interfaces with few buttons, 3D games require new control interfaces to providing sufficient control options without limiting the field of view on the screen. This is important to improve the user experience. Within this work new ideas based on the use of the accelerometer as indirect control mechanism are presented. The accelerometer is used to switch between different interaction layers, which are also different game views for the player. Combined with this concept a buttonless touch area interface is used. We are planning to evaluate the ideas with a 3D game prototype running on Android devices. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Music therapy and music and rhythm in general can support standard physiotherapy for people suffering from Parkinson's disease to improve the motion performance and quality, sometimes even helping to overcome motion blocks. With the availability of cheap motion-tracking devices, exergames have become an interesting option to complement traditional physiotherapy. However, the role of music and rhythm in the context of games for this special audience is still largely unexplored. Based on a prototype exergame we developed, a user study was conducted to compare the effects of different auditory clues and their absence in exergames for this target group. The results show significant performance differences with music versus without music, but surprisingly no differences were found between music synchronized with the interaction and unsynchronized background music. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Designing digital games is primarily interaction design. This interaction manifests as a meaningful change in the game world. An aspect of a game can only change dynamically with a parametric model of this aspect available. One aspect of digital games is yet missing such a systematic description: the genre of a game is currently only determined by its designer. This paper introduces a new approach that allows for dynamic blending between genres. We describe a set of game mechanics that express the characteristics of different game genres. We extract a parametric model from these mechanics to allow dynamic blending. The paper illustrates the possibilities of this approach with an implementation of a multi-genre-game. It also provides empiric evidence that the described model successfully generates different game genres. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Getting the timing and dynamics right is key to creating believable and interesting animations. However, using traditional keyframe animation techniques, timing is a tedious and abstract process. In this paper we present Dragimation, a novel technique for interactive performative timing of keyframe animations. It is inspired by direct manipulation techniques for video navigation that leverage the natural sense of timing all of us possess. We conducted a user study with 27 participants including professional animators as well as novices, in which we compared our approach to two other interactive timing techniques, timeline scrubbing and sketch-based timing. Dragimation is comparable regarding objective error measurements to the sketch-based approach and significantly better than scrubbing and is the overall preferred technique by our test users.},

abstract={The partnership of theater and digital media shows much potential for new means of storytelling. Digital scenery can be joined to the performer's action on stage; algorithmic influences can blur the linearity of a drama; interactive technology offers novel means of involving the audience in the creation of the piece. Interaction can thus enhance the dramaturgical possibilities of traditional theater. However, the narrative task also accompanies various new challenges for the designers of such a play. On the basis of our dance performance Parcival XX-XI, we define requirements for making an audience interact in a theatrical play and introduce four interaction-enabling criteria for theatrical performances that use gestural interfaces. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Games for rehabilitation are developing rapidly in recent years. It has been shown that utilization of therapy and gaming technology affects positively on the patients' physical and mental condition. However, to this day there are only few playable games for Parkinson's disease patients. This paper presents the development process of WuppDi! - a collection of five motion-based games for Parkinson's disease patients, aimed at supporting their exercises routines in various playful environments. We describe the game design challenges for Parkinson's disease patients and our solutions used in the games. Finally, we present the results of a conducted field test showing a very positive motivational effect among the majority of the patients but also highlighting remaining issues and technical difficulties, which can be beneficial for the future development in this field. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={3D modelling and animation software is typically operated via single-pointer input, imposing a serialised workflow that seems cumbersome in comparison to how humans manipulate objects in the real world. Research has brought forth new interaction techniques for modelling and animation that utilise input with more degrees of freedom or employ both hands to allow more parallel control, yet these are separate efforts across diverse input technologies and have not been applied to a usable system. We developed a 3D modelling and animation system for multi-touch interactive surfaces, as this technology offers parallel input with many degrees of freedom through one or both hands. It implements techniques for one-handed 3D navigation, 3D object manipulation, and time control. This includes mappings for layered or multi-track performance animation that allows the animation of different features across several passes or the modification of previously recorded motion. We show how these unimanual techniques can be combined for efficient bimanual control and propose techniques that specifically support the use of both hands for typical tasks in 3D editing. A study proved that even inexperienced users can successfully use our system for a more parallel and direct modelling or animation process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the domain of 2D graphical applications multi-touch input is already quite well understood and smoothly integrated translation and rotation of objects widely accepted as a standard interaction technique. However, in 3D VR, modeling, or animation applications, there are no such generally accepted interaction techniques for multi-touch displays featuring the same smooth and fluid interaction style. In this paper we present two novel techniques for integrated 6 degrees of freedom object manipulation on multi-touch displays. They are designed to transfer the smooth 2D interaction properties provided by multi-touch input to the 3D domain. One makes separation of rotation and translation easier, while the other strives for maximum integration of rotation and translation. We present a first user study showing that while both techniques can be used successfully for unimanual and bimanual integrated 3D rotation and translation, the more integrated technique is faster and easier to use. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the physical world we use both hands in a very distinctive manner. Much research has been dedicated to transfer this principle to the digital realm, including multi-touch interactive surfaces. However, without the possibility to reliably distinguish between hands, interaction design is very limited. We present an approach for enhancing multi-touch systems based on diffuse illumination with left and right hand distinction. Using anatomical properties of the human hand we derive a simple empirical model and heuristics that, when fed into a decision tree classifier, enable real-time hand distinction for multi-touch applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We present a selection technique for 2D and 3D environments based on proxy objects designed to improve selection of occluded and dynamic objects. We explore the design space for proxies, of which we implemented the properties colour similarity and motion similarity and tested them in a user study. Our technique significantly increases selection precision but is slower than the reference selection technique, suggesting a mix of both to optimise speed versus error rate for real world applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The representation of 2D data in 3D information spaces is becoming increasingly popular. Many different layout and interaction metaphors are in use, but it is unclear how these perform in comparison to each other and across different input devices. In this paper we present the ElasticSteer technique for navigation in 3D information spaces using relative gestures for mouse and multi-touch input. It realises steering control with visual feedback on direction and speed via a rubber band metaphor. ElasticSteer includes unconstrained and constrained navigation specifically designed for the wall, carousel or corridor visualisation metaphors. A study shows that ElasticSteer can be used successfully by novice users and performs comparably for mouse and multi-touch input. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Hypernym discovery is an essential task for building and extending ontologies automatically. In comparison to the whole Web as a source for information extraction, online encyclopedias provide far more structuredness and reliability. In this paper we propose a novel approach that combines syntactic and lexical-semantic information to identify hypernymic relationships. We compiled semi-automatically and manually created training data and a gold standard for evaluation with the first sentences from the German version of Wikipedia. We trained a sequential supervised learner with a semantically enhanced tagset. The experiments showed that the cleanliness of the data is far more important than the amount of the same. Furthermore, it was shown that bootstrapping is a viable approach to ameliorate the results. Our approach outperformed the competitive lexico-syntactic patterns by 7% leading to an F1-measure of over .91. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate how discourse context in the form of short-term memory can be exploited to automatically group consecutive strokes in digital freehand sketching. With this machine learning approach, no database of explicit object representations is used for template matching on a complete scene-instead, grouping decisions are based on limited spatio-temporal context. We employ two different classifier formalisms for this time series analysis task, namely Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). ESNs present internal-state classifiers with inherent memory capabilities. For the conventional static SVM, short-term memory is supplied externally via fixed-length feature vector expansion. We compare the respective setup heuristics and conduct experiments with two exemplary problems. Promising results are achieved with both formalisms. Yet, our experiments indicate that using ESNs for variable-length memory tasks alleviates the risk of overfitting due to non-expressive features or improperly determined temporal embedding dimensions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Interactive surfaces are only just beginning to break into the market, and they still do not offer the advanced functionality demonstrated with many lab prototypes. The path from a prototype system to a finished product for use in real-world scenarios is a long one, and many obstacles must be overcome. The design of an interactive multitouch table had to address issues like optical recognition, hardware design, and ergonomics. This paper describes in detail the construction of a large, robust multi-touch table called mrT. It will show how to solve major problems of the diffuse illumination technique and other challenges of constructing a large-screen, high-resolution, self-contained interactive multitouch surface that not only serves as a development system but can be deployed in the real-world. Additionally, to further motivate some of the design decisions, especially why the diffuse illumination technology was chosen, this paper will discuss related on-going research projects on the application side.

abstract={Computer games and serious geographic information systems (GIS) share many requirements with regard to storage, exchange, and visualization of geographic data. Furthermore, there is a demand for high-fidelity photo-realistic and non-photo-realistic visualization. This poses at least two questions: Is there a single data format standard suitable for serious GIS-based applications and computer games that supports state-of-the-art visual quality? How can computer games and serious applications benefit from each other, especially platform-wise? In this paper we will investigate both questions by taking a closer look at the CityGML standard in comparison to COLLADA and we will report on our findings in integrating CityGML with mainstream game technology. The main contribution of this paper to the field is a suggested way of integrating an important features of CityGML and Collada for high-quality visualization, i.e. programmable shader effects, and demonstrating the feasibility of employing a game console as a cheap and widely available device for geodata visualization and possibly other geodata-centric applications. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Focus of the paper is the conversion of driving characteristics of prevalently used electric wheelchairs into the virtual physics system of the used computer game engine. The used parameters are systematically balanced between the virtual and the real world to evaluate the realism of the driving characteristics of an electric wheelchair using the integrated physics simulation of the Unreal Engine 3. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Each day millions of people play digital games with different motivations. These motivations rang from time beating to deep immersion into a narration or interacting with a community. To address all these different means, a range of game designs is necessary. Traditional human computation games cannot present all these aspects yet. This work will give a game centered view on game design for human computation. To demonstrate the value of this view it will present a fast-paced action game called OnTo-Galaxy along with two different human computation tasks. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Popular Web folksonomy systems such as Delicious or Flickr allow users to create web contents and annotate them with a set of freely chosen keywords (tags) in order to organize them for later retrieval. Unfortunately, existing user interfaces of folksonomy systems have limited browsing capabilities and do not exploit tag semantics sufficiently for browsing linked data. In this paper, we present Semantic Cloud, an approach for exploring data in folksonomy systems based on a hierarchical semantic representation of the tag-space, which is obtained by analyzing folksonomy data.

abstract={In multiagent-based simulation systems the agent programming paradigm is adopted for simulation. This simulation approach offers the promise to facilitate the design and development of complex simulations, both regarding the distinct simulation actors and the simulation environment itself. We introduce the simulation middleware PlaSMA which extends the JADE agent framework with a simulation control that ensures synchronization and provides a world model based on a formal ontological description of the respective application domain. We illustrate the benefits of an ontology grounding for simulation design and discuss further gains to be expected from recent advances in ontology engineering, namely the adaption of foundational ontologies and modelling-patterns. © ECMS.},

abstract={Designing user interfaces for ubiquitous computing applications is a challenging task. In this paper we discuss how to build intelligent interfaces. The foundations are usability principles that are valid on very general levels. We present a number of established methods for the design process that can help to meet these principle requirements. In particular participatory and iterative so-called human centered approaches are important for interfaces in ubiquitous computing. In particular the question how to make interactional interfaces more intelligent is not trivial and there are multiple approaches to enhance either the intelligence of the system or that of the user. Novel interface approaches, presented herein, follow the idea of embodied interaction and put particular emphasis on the situated use of a system and the mental models humans develop in context. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a novel approach that combines syntactic and context information to identify lexical semantic relationships. We compiled semi-automatically and manually created training data and a test set for evaluation with the first sentences from the German version of Wikipedia. We trained the Trigrams'n'Tags Tagger by Brants (Brants, 2000) with a semantically enhanced tagset. The experiments showed that the cleanliness of the data is far more important than the amount of the same. Furthermore, it was shown that bootstrapping is a viable approach to ameliorate the results. Our approach outperformed the competitive lexico-syntactic patterns by 7% leading to an F1-measure of .91.},

abstract={For the foreseeable future, testing will remain the mainstay of software quality assurance and measurement in all areas of software development, including Web services and service-oriented systems. In general, however, testing Web services is much more challenging than testing normal software applications, not because they are inherently more complex, but because of the limited control and access that users of Web services have over their development and deployment. Whereas the developers of normal applications, by definition, have full control over their application until release time, and thus, can subject them to all kinds of tests in various combinations (e.g., integration testing, system testing, regression testing, acceptance testing, etc.), users of Web services can often only test them at run-time after they have already been deployed and put into service. Moreover, users of Web services often have to share access to them with other concurrent users. In order to effectively test Web services under these conditions special measures and approaches need to be taken to enhance their testability. Right from the early phases of development, the testability of services needs to be taken into account and "designed into" services. In this chapter we consider these issues and with the aid of a case study we present a methodology that can be used to enhance the testability of Web services. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={Map interfaces are the quasi-standard for car navigation systems, and are usually the first choice for mobile pedestrian navigation systems. Alternatives are being investigated in research and industry that possibly suit the settings and needs of the person on foot better. One solution is augmented reality (AR), which blends navigation instructions with the view of the real world. However, research usually focuses too much on the technical implementation, leaving little time for a thorough assessment of the actual benefits of such a system. In this paper we present an evaluation of a mobile pedestrian navigation system prototype. The system provides a simplified augmented reality experience by presenting visually augmented photographs instead of a real-time video stream. We compare the usability of the AR interface with that of a map-based interface in a field evaluation. Our results challenge the map approach and suggest that AR is not only a serious alternative, but also potentially more suited for route presentation in PNS. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

abstract={Today component- and service-based technologies play a central role in many aspects of enterprise computing. However, although the technologies used to define, implement, and assemble components have improved significantly over recent years, techniques for verifying systems created from them have changed very little. The correctness and reliability of component-based systems are still usually checked using the traditional testing techniques that were in use before components and services became widespread, and the associated costs and overheads still remain high. This paper presents an approach that addresses this problem by making the system verification process more component-oriented. Based on the notion of built-in tests (BIT)-tests that are packaged and distributed with prefabricated, off-the-shelf components-the approach partially automates the testing process, thereby reducing the level of effort needed to establish the acceptability of the system. The approach consists of a method that defines how components should be written to support and make use of run-time tests, and a resource-aware infrastructure that arranges for tests to be executed when they have a minimal impact on the delivery of system services. After providing an introduction to the principles behind component-based verification and explaining the main features of the approach and its supporting infrastructure, we show by means of a case study how it can reduce system verification effort. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract={In this paper we address the question of how traditional approaches to modeling world knowledge, i.e. to model shared conceptualizations of specific domains of interest via formal ontologies, can be enhanced by a pragmatic layer to solve the problem of explicating hitherto implicit information contained in the user's utterances and to further the assistance capabilities of dialog systems and how they can be connected to dedicated analyzers that observe topical contextual information. For this purpose, the notions of context and pragmatics are introduced as one of the central problems facing applications in artificial intelligence. We will argue that pragmatic inferences are impossible without contextual observations and introduce a model of context-adaptive processing using a combination of formal ontologies and analyzers for various types of context.},

abstract={In this paper we describe a new approach for increasing the reliability of ubiquitous software systems. This is achieved by executing tests at run-time. The individual software components are consequently accompanied by executable tests. We augment this well-known built-in test (BIT) paradigm by combining it with resource-awareness. Starting from the constraints for such resource-aware tests (RATs) we derive their design and describe a number of strategies for executing such tests under resource constraints as well as the necessary middleware. Our approach is especially beneficial to ubiquitous software systems due to their dynamic nature - which prevents a static verification of their reliability - and their inherent resource limitations.

abstract={Runtime testing is important for improving the quality of software systems. This fact holds true especially for systems which cannot be completely assembled at development time, such as mobile or ad-hoc systems. The concepts of Built-In-test (BIT) can be used to cope with runtime testing, but to our knowledge there does not exist an implemented infrastructure for BIT. The MORABIT project realizes such an infrastructure and extends the BIT concepts to allow for a smooth integration of the testing process and the original business functionality execution. In this paper the requirements on the infrastructure and our solution are presented. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Summary: We describe the role of context models in natural language processing systems and their implementation and evaluation in the SmartKom system. We show that contextual knowledge is needed for an ensemble of tasks, such as lexical and pragmatic disambiguation, decontextualizion of domain and common-sense knowledge that was left implicit by the user and for estimating an overall coherence score that is used in intention recognition. As the successful evaluations show, the implemented context model enables a multicontext system, such as SmartKom, to respond felicitously to contextually underspecified questions. This ability constitutes an important step toward making dialogue systems more intuitively usable and conversational without losing their reliability and robustness.},

A significant subset of these are constituted by external data and service providers. The work presented herein describes the challenging task of integrating such external data and service sources to make them semantically accessible to other systems and users. We present the implemented multiagent system the corresponding knowledge-based extraction and integration approach. As a whole these agents cooperate to provide users with topical high-quality information via unified and intuitively usable interfaces such as the SmartKom system.},

abstract={Information systems for mobile users need additional context information for delivering location based services. In simple systems, this additional context is just given as spatial coordinates. For more complex and intelligent systems, more detailed models of both the spatial context and user situations are needed. -To make such models formal, explicit and sharable, e.g. by means of ontologies, is still a challenging matter. Ontological descriptions of spatial context could be used in various ways for understanding user needs and customizing semantically described services and information objects.},

abstract={What are the most suitable interaction paradigms for navigational and informative tasks for pedestrians? Is there an influence of social and situational context on multimodal interaction? Our study takes a closer look at a multimodal system on a handheld device that was recently developed as a prototype for mobile navigation assistance. The system allows visitors of a city to navigate, to get information on sights, and to use and manipulate map information. In an outdoor evaluation, we studied the usability of such a system on site. The study yields insight about how multimodality can enhance the usability of hand-held devices with their future services. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) in the real world is still an unsolved task. Beyond toy systems there are no scalable solutions for outdoor systems that include augmented real-time graphics. The problems are multifold: rendering capacities, tracking problems, data handling and gaps in coverage of tracking and/or graphic data. Our approach introduces an edutainment system that presents an AR system for edutainment. We work around these problems through a stage-based approach for AR. Stages are AR-islands in the real world, where selected functions can be performed. The stages are connected through a navigational system that links them together. For our application domain, an edutainment system, we employ a digital story telling scenario that links the stages semantically. Human computer-interaction in the proposed system is through a multi-modal interface that can be accessed through various devices. The advantage of our stage-based system is scalability and robustness of an outdoor and real-world AR system. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={In the research domain agent-based systems are widely used for mobile and distributed information systems. Their underlying paradigm provides excellent mechanism's to isolate tasks in independent modules that can be reused and combined in multiple ways. In order to facilitate the communication between such agents a common domain-knowledge needs to be collected and stored in an ontology. This paper introduces an XML-based ontology representation for mobile multi-agent systems. A uniform XSLT-based mechanism that allows for transforming agent communication into a format readable by human users is presented. We show how the resulting combination of domain representation and presentation allows highly flexible agent systems where users interface agents can feed information from any service agent to the user or vice versa and how this approach can be easily extended to take user- or contextadaptive presentation strategies into account. Additionally, we describe how these mechanisms are integrated into a prototypical mobile multi-modal tourist information system and we present some evaluation results. ©Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={This paper presents an architecture for image analysis that is based on feature hierarchies. The architecture allows for shift, scale, and topological invariant detection of objects. Features are efficiently represented and combined dynamically during the detection process. The respective feature detectors are trained using a supervised learning scheme. The method discussed here can also solve the problem of segmenting an image into image regions that correspond to detected features. This segmentation can be done through backtracking of feature information in the feature hierarchy. We applied the method for a set of images where building facades are analyzed and show experimental results that demonstrate the capabilities of the system.},

abstract={This paper presents our integrated hotel reservation service. Using it as a case study, we discuss the design and implementation of agent-based information systems. Taking a system as a whole, we consider not only information agents but also their interface to human users and external information sources. In particular, our focus is on the interaction behavior, which can be observed both in interactions between agents and in interactions between agents and these interface components. We show that both kinds of interaction are coordinated by the same protocol. Using our implemented hotel reservation service system, we illustrate exemplarily how this understanding can be used to systematically design and validate interaction mechanism. We explore the possibility to facilitate the rapid prototyping of information agent systems using an interaction behavior editor. Moreover, by giving insight into some details of our hotel service system, we exemplify where the difficulties in implementing information agent systems are and thus infrastructural support are desirable.},

This paper presents a user study investigating the effects of different output modality-combinations on the effectiveness to transport information and on the user's acceptance of the system. We chose a tourist information system as a test environment and conducted the study on three different devices (PDA, TV set, and desktop computer) to investigate whether the best modality-combination depends on the used device. It turned out that the modality-combination of spoken text in connection with a picture was the most effective regarding recall-performance. This effect was strongest for users working with PDAs, which can be explained by the cognitive load theory. In contrast to this, participants ranked different modality combinations as most appealing, namely those with written text.},

abstract={This paper presents RAJA, a Resource-Adaptive Java Agent Infrastructure. RAJA is easily accessible to agent developers, since it allows structured programming by using a multi-level architecture to clearly separate domain-specific functionality from resource and adaptation concerns. It is generic, since it is applicable to a wide range of adaptation strategies. These two key features are illustrated by several applications, where the RAJA concept has been successfully applied to solve real world problems. They stem from very different domains (video streaming and spatial reasoning), which demonstrates the wide range of application and the flexibility of the proposed infrastructure.},

abstract={More and more people combine several purposes with travelling, such as business, leisure, entertainment, and education. Such people may not have time to pre-plan a travel schedule in detail. They need location-aware information about the destination domain and expect individualised information and services. The EU funded research project CRUMPET addresses these factors and will provide new information delivery services for a far more heterogeneous tourist population. The services proposed by CRUMPET take advantage of integrating four key emerging technology domains and applying them to the tourism domain: location-aware services, personalised user interaction, seamlessly accessible multi-media mobile communication, and smart component-based middleware or 'smartware' that uses Multi-Agent Technology.},

abstract={Most artificial neural networks used in practical applications are based on simple neuron types in a multi-layer architecture. Here, we propose to solve optimization problems using a fully recurrent network of spiking neurons mimicking the response behavior of biological neurons. Such networks can compute a series of different solutions for a given problem and converge into a periodical sequence of such solutions. The goal of this paper is to prove that neural networks like the SRM (Spike Response Model) are able to solve nonlinear optimization problems. We demonstrate this for the traveling salesman problem. Our network model is able to compute multiple solutions and can use its dynamics to leave local minima in which classical models would be stuck. For adapting the model, we introduce a suitable network architecture and show how to encode the problem directly into the network weights.},

abstract={Biologically motivated neuronal models have become popular in auto-associative recurrent networks due to their ability to solve the binding problem and to segment complex scenes into previously stored components. Most approaches only use simple Hebbian learning which works best for orthogonal patterns. This paper presents a learning algorithm based on perceptron learning which enhances the storage capability in such neural networks and also allows correlated patterns. As these iterative learning algorithms allow weights to grow arbitrarily, the amount of network input may also grow arbitrarily and can cause desynchronization. We therefore incorporate a method to ensure a constant network input for trained patterns while facilitating the switching from one attractor to a different one when a sequence of patterns is generated.},

abstract={Classical conditioning is a basic form of associative learning in the animal kingdom. Many paradigmatic features of classical conditioning appear to be conserved throughout species and phyla and are independent of stimulus nature. This paper presents an analysis of trial-based and real-time models of classical conditioning which are mathematical abstractions of the underlying processing principles. Various models are reviewed and in a formal analysis, their capability of simulating and explaining classical conditioning is investigated. Since every existing model fails to simulate some particular conditioning phenomena and since some modelling approaches are not appropriate for detailed mathematical analysis, new model components will be introduced that overcome most of the weaknesses observed in the other models.},

abstract={One class of theoretical accounts of associative learning suggests that reinforcers are processed according to learning rules that minimize the predictive error between the expected strength of future reinforcement and its actual strength. The omission of reinforcement in a situation where it is expected leads to inhibitory learning of stimuli indicative for such a violation of the prediction. There are, however, results indicating that inhibitory learning can also be induced by other mechanisms. Here, we present data from olfactory reward conditioning in honeybees that show that (1) one- and multiple-trial backward conditioning results in conditioned inhibition (CI); (2) the inhibition is maximal for a 15-sec interval between US and CS; (3) there is a nonmonotonic dependency on the degree of CI from the US-CS interval during backward pairing; and (4) the prior association of context stimuli with reinforcement is not necessary for the development of CI. These results cannot be explained by models that only minimize a prediction error. Rather, they are consistent with models of associative learning that, in addition, assume that learning depends on the temporal overlap of a CS with two processes, a fast excitatory and a slow inhibitory one, both evoked by a reinforcer. The findings from this behavioral analysis of reinforcement processing are compared with the known properties of an individual, identified neuron involved in reinforcement processing in the bee brain, to further understand the mechanisms underlying predictive reward learning.},

abstract={One point often raised during the discussions was the interdependence of function and structure. Several examples clearly showed that natural organisms have developed a lot of specialized organs or strategies (facette eye of the fly, interpretation of sensory inputs within the behavioral context), which are useful for the organism in the natural environment and reduce the necessary amount of computation. One major outcome for both computer scientists and neurobiologists was that artificial and natural organisms should be investigated in their interaction with the environment. Only by doing so, adaptations and specializations in natural organisms can be completely understood, and the fitness of an artificial organism can be assessed.},

The method finds the parameters of one oscillator model such that its dynamics are equivalent to that of another oscillator model. Although this equivalence is obtained using the assumption of harmonic oscillations, it can be shown in simulations that these transformed neural oscillators not only behave equivalently in the state of harmonic balance, but also mainly equivalent in stationary and chaotic activation states. Moreover, even networks consisting of those oscillators show equivalent dynamics under very different dynamic regimes. © 1997 IEEE.},

abstract={Real-time models of classical conditioning simulate features of associative learning including its dependence on the timing of stimuli. We present the Sutton/Barto model, the TD model, the CP model, the drive-reinforcement model, and the SOP model in a framework of reinforcement learning rules. The role of eligibility and reinforcement is analyzed and the ability of the models to simulate time-dependent learning (e.g. inhibitory backward conditioning) and other conditioning phenomena is compared. A new model is introduced, that is mathematically simple, and overcomes weaknesses of the other models. This model combines the two antagonistic US traces of the SOP model with the reinforcement term of the TD model.},

abstract={We present a formal model of olfactory transduction corresponding to the biochemical reaction cascade found in chemosensory neurons. It assumes that odorants bind to receptor proteins which, in turn, activate transducer mechanisms corresponding to second messenger-mediated processes. The model is reformulated as a mathematically equivalent artificial neural network (ANN). To enable comparison of the computational power of our model, previously suggested models of chemosensory transduction are also presented in ANN versions. In ANNs, certain biological parameters, such as rate constants and affinities, are transformed into weights that can be fitted by training with a given experimental data set. After training, these weights do not necessarily equal the real biological parameters, but represent a set of values that is sufficient to simulate an experimental set of data. We used ANNs to simulate data recorded from bee subplacodes and compare the capacity of our model with ANN versions of other models. Receptor neurons of the nonpheromonal, general odor-processing subsystem of the honeybee are broadly tuned, have overlapping response spectra, and show highly nonlinear concentration dependencies and mixture interactions, i.e., synergistic and inhibitory effects. Our full model alone has the necessary complexity to simulate these complex response characteristics. To account for the complex response characteristics of honeybee receptor neurons, we suggest that several different receptor protein types and at least two second messenger systems are necessary that may interact at various levels of the transduction cascade and may eventually have opposing effects on receptor neuron excitability. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We introduce a neural network model using spiking neurons. The neuron model is a biological neuron with Hodgkin-Huxley channels. We compare the network's ability of auto-associative pattern recognition to that of the Hopfield network. The model recognizes patterns by converging into dynamic stable states of synchronous firing activity. This activity can last for arbitrary time or return to a resting activation after stimulus offset. The neural network model solves the binding problem. It can separate a compound pattern into its components by encoding these in stable subpattern states of the same firing frequency separated from each other by phase shift.},

abstract={A modeling approach for chemosensory reception using artificial neural networks is presented. We introduce a new model for chemosensory receptors, that models reactions between odor molecules and receptor proteins and the activation of second messenger by receptor proteins. The mathematical formulation of the reaction kinetics is transformed into an artificial neural network (ANN). Many previously proposed models we have transformed to ANNs in the same way. For the resulting feed-forward networks learning algorithms provide a powerful means for parameter fitting. The weights of the networks corresponding to chemical parameters can be trained by presenting experimental data. We demonstrate the simulation capabilities of our model with experimental data from honey bee chemosensory neurons and compare it with previously proposed models. It can be shown that our model based on the reaction kinetics is sufficient to rebuild the observed data, whereas simpler models are not able to do this task.},
