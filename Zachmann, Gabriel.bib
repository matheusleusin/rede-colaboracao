abstract={Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a highly successful surgical procedure, but complications remain, including aseptic loosening, early dislocation and misalignment. These may partly be related to lacking training opportunities for novices or those performing THA less frequently. A standardized training setting with realistic haptic feedback for THA does not exist to date. Virtual Reality (VR) may help establish THA training scenarios under standardized settings, morphology and material properties. This work summarizes the development and acquisition of mechanical properties on hip reaming, resulting in a tissue-based material model of the acetabulum for force feedback VR hip reaming simulators. With the given forces and torques occurring during the reaming, Cubic Hermite Spline interpolation seemed the most suitable approach to represent the nonlinear force–displacement behavior of the acetabular tissues over Cubic Splines. Further, Cubic Hermite Splines allowed for a rapid force feedback computation below the 1 ms hallmark. The Cubic Hermite Spline material model was implemented using a three-dimensional-sphere packing model. The resulting forces were delivered via a human–machine-interaction certified KUKA iiwa robotic arm used as a force feedback device. Consequently, this novel approach presents a concept to obtain mechanical data from high-force surgical interventions as baseline data for material models and biomechanical considerations; this will allow THA surgeons to train with a variety of machining hardness levels of acetabula for haptic VR acetabulum reaming. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Introduction: Bühler's anastomosis (or Bühler's arcade) is an embryonic relic and represents an arterio-arterial connection between the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk. It can be found as a variety in 1–2% of patients. Case Presentation: We present a case of a patient with metatastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The patient was in stable disease for 4 years under palliative therapy (most recently second-line therapy with Nevolumab). In 2019, a locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the papilla vateri was diagnosed, additionally. The patient also underwent right hemicolectomy and patch plasty of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery due to colonic ischemia and arteriosclerotic disease with 50–70% stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery several years ago. Due to a complex vascular prehistory, the standardized preoperative imaging was supplemented by two independent vascular reconstructions (a CT angiogram and a reconstruction based on the CT) for the planning of a pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection and reconstruction according to Traverso-Longmire. In addition, a 3D print was produced. Both, the reconstruction based on the CT scan and the 3D print were created for off-label use as a part of a research project (VIVATOP: Versatile Immersive Virtual and Augmented Tangible OP). Discussion: In the standardized CT scan and in the clinical CT-angiography, there were no obvious surgically relevant anatomical variations. A Bühler anastomosis was detected in a digital, virtual and interactive 3D-reconstruction. In addition, in the 3D print of the abdominal site the anastomosis was seen as well. Intraoperatively, the presence of Bühler's anastomosis was confirmed. This information had a significant impact on the intraoperative approach. Retrospectively, the vessel variant could be surmised in the axial projection of the CT scan, if one knew what to look for. Conclusion: For the conduction of a safe surgical procedure, it is imperative that rare anatomical variations are known preoperatively. Increasing digitalization in surgical and perioperative preparation holds great potential for better planning and improved patient safety. Research and cooperation projects such as the VIVATOP project are instrumental for the development of new visualization techniques, which are able to enhance the understanding of complex anatomical relations. © Copyright © 2020 Templin, Tabriz, Hoffmann, Uslar, Lück, Schenk, Malaka, Zachmann, Kluge and Weyhe.},

abstract={Recent results suggest that biometric identification based on human's eye movement characteristics can be used for authentication. In this paper, we present three new methods and benchmark them against the state-of-the-art. The best of our new methods improves the state-of-the-art performance by 5.2 percentage points. Furthermore, we investigate some of the factors that affect the robustness of the recognition rate of different classifiers on gaze trajectories, such as the type of stimulus and the tracking trajectory length. We find that the state-of-the-art method only works well when using the same stimulus for testing that was used for training. By contrast, our novel method more than doubles the identification accuracy for these transfer cases. Furthermore, we find that with only 90 seconds of eye tracking data, 86.7% accuracy can be achieved. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={We present a novel haptic rendering method to simulate material removal in medical simulations at haptic rates. The core of our method is a new massively-parallel continuous collision detection algorithm in combination with a stable and flexible 6-DOF collision response scheme that combines penalty-and constraint-based force computation. Moreover, a volumetric object representation of the 3D objects allows us to derive a realistic local material model from experimental human cadaveric data, as well as support real-time continuous material removal. We have applied our algorithm to a hip replacement simulator and two dentistry-related simulations for root-canal opening and caries removal. The results show realistic continuous forces and torques at haptic rates. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Since RGB-D sensors became massively popular and are used in a wide range of applications, depth data compression became an important research topic. Live-streaming of depth data requires quick compression and decompression. Accurate preservation of information is crucial in order to prevent geometric distortions. Custom algorithms are needed considering the unique characteristics of depth images. We propose a real-time, lossless algorithm which can achieve significantly higher compression ratios than RVL. The core elements are an adaptive span-wise intra-image prediction, and parallelization. Additionally, we extend the algorithm by inter-frame difference computation and evaluate the performance regarding different conditions. Lastly, the compression ratio can be further increased by a second encoder, circumventing the lower limit of four-bit per valid pixel of the original RVL algorithm. © 2020, Vaclav Skala Union Agency.

abstract={Advances in computer technology and increasing usage of computer graphics in a broad field of applications lead to rapidly rising demands regarding size and detail of virtual landscapes. Manually creating huge, realistic looking terrains and populating them densely with assets is an expensive and laborious task. In consequence, (semi-)automatic procedural terrain generation is a popular method to reduce the amount of manual work. However, such methods are usually highly specialized for certain terrain types and especially the procedural generation of landscapes composed of different biomes is a scarcely explored topic. We present a novel system, called AutoBiomes, which is capable of efficiently creating vast terrains with plausible biome distributions and therefore different spatial characteristics. The main idea is to combine several synthetic procedural terrain generation techniques with digital elevation models (DEMs) and a simplified climate simulation. Moreover, we include an easy-to-use asset placement component which creates complex multi-object distributions. Our system relies on a pipeline approach with a major focus on usability. Our results show that our system allows the fast creation of realistic looking terrains. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Large high-resolution displays (LHRDs) provide an enabling technology to achieve immersive, isometrically registered, virtual environments. It has been shown that LHRDs allow better size judgments, higher collaboration performance, and shorter task completion times. This paper presents novel insights into human size perception using large-scale floor displays, in particular in-depth evaluations of size judgment accuracy, precision, and task completion time. These investigations have been performed in the context of six, novel applications in the domain of automotive production planning. In our studies, we used a 54-sqm sized LED floor and a standard tablet visualizing relatively scaled and true to scale 2D content, which users had to estimate using different aids. The study involved 22 participants and three different conditions. Results indicate that true to scale floor visualizations reduce the mean absolute percentage error of spatial estimations. In all three conditions, we did not find the typical overestimation or underestimation of size judgments. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={We present a novel data structure for SIMD optimized simultaneous bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) traversals like they appear for instance in collision detection tasks. In contrast to all previous approaches, we consider both the traversal algorithm and the construction of the BVH. The main idea is to increase the branching factor of the BVH according to the available SIMD registers and parallelize the simultaneous BVH traversal using SIMD operations. This requires a novel BVH construction method because traditional BVHs for collision detection usually are simple binary trees. To do that, we present a new BVH construction method based on a clustering algorithm, Batch Neural Gas, that is able to build efficient n-ary tree structures along with SIMD optimized simultaneous BVH traversal. Our results show that our new data structure outperforms binary trees significantly. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With an increasing product complexity in manufacturing industry, virtual reality (VR) offers the possibility to immersively assess assembly processes already in early product development stages. Within production validation phases, engineers visually assess product part assembly and interactively validate corresponding production processes. Nevertheless, by now research does not give answers on how VR assembly system’s performance can be measured with respect to its technical limitations. The proposed Virtual Reality Assembly Assessment (VR2A) benchmark is an open, standardized experiment design for evaluating the overall VR assembly assessment performance in terms of sizes and clearances instead of measuring single technical impact factors within the interaction cycle, such as tracking, rendering and visualization limitations. VR2A benchmark focusses on the overall production engineer’s assessment objective generating quantifiable metrics. Using VR2A, users gain practical insights on their overall VR assessment system’s performance and limitations. An in-depth evaluation with production engineers (N=32) revealed, that negative clearances can be detected more easily than positive ones, part sizes directly correlate with the assessment performance. Additionally, the evaluation showed that VR2A is easy to use, universally usable and generates objective insights on the applied VR system. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The”VaMEx - Valles Marineris Explorer” initiative is part of the DLR Explorer Initiatives. As such it is an interdisciplinary research program funded by the DLR Space Administration aimed at developing new concepts, algorithms and hardware for swarm-based exploration of the Valles Marineris on Mars. This includes a hominid robotic platform (project VaMEx-VIPe), autonomous swarm navigation including ground vehicles and UAVs (project VaMEx-CoSMiC) that rely on a local positioning and landing system (project VaMEx-LAOLa), and orbital support (VaMEx-NavComNet) serving as a science data, telemetry and telecommand relay between Earth and the in-situ elements and providing near real-time position updates to the other elements. Real validation and verification tests for such complex navigation and exploration systems are difficult, expensive and time-consuming because they require the availability of hardware, realistic environments and software-in-the-loop. In this paper, we present VaMEx-VTB, a virtual testbed (VTB) that enables the verification and validation of such large and complex interdisciplinary research projects during very early phases. The basic idea of VaMEx-VTB is to provide a common software platform for all modules in combination with a sophisticated user definable computer simulation thereby it helps reducing expensive and time-consuming physical testing. Additionally, it can serve as an integration and discussion hub during the development process. The VTB allows users to configure various aspects of the test scenarios and the test environment, such as physical parameters, atmospheric conditions, or terrain features. This is essential especially for extraterrestrial planetary missions that are difficult to reconstruct on earth. Finally, a sophisticated graphical feedback, based on a state-of-the-art game engine, allows an easy and direct interaction of the engineers with the test case in the VTB. Our modular design based on ROS supports consistent data access for all components. So far, we have implemented a realistic simulation of the relevant environmental parameters and created an adjustable model of the Valles Marineris terrain, based on the HiRISE data. Additionally, the VTB synthesizes realistic sensor input for several algorithms running on the swarm elements. The modular design concept also qualifies the VTB to serve as a testing platform for other extraterrestrial missions in the future.

abstract={We present a novel algorithm, called AstroGen, to procedurally generate highly detailed and realistic 3D meshes of small celestial bodies automatically. AstroGen gains it's realism from learning surface details from real world asteroid data. We use a sphere packing-based metaball approach to represent the rough shape and a set of noise functions for the surface details. The main idea is to apply an optimization algorithm to adopt these representations to available highly detailed asteroid models with respect to a similarity measure. Our results show that our approach is able to generate a wide variety of different celestial bodies with very complex surface structures like caves and craters. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We developed a prototype of a virtual, immersive, and interactive anatomy atlas for surgical anatomical training. The aim of this study was to test the usability of the VR anatomy atlas and to measure differences in knowledge acquirement between an immersive content delivery medium and conventional learning (OB). Twenty-eight students of the 11th grade of two german high schools randomly divided into two groups. One group used conventional anatomy books and charts whereas the other group used the VR Anatomy Atlas to answer nine anatomy questions. Error rate, duration for answering the individual questions, satisfaction with the teaching unit, and existence of a medical career wish were evaluated as a function of the learning method. The error rate was the same for both schools and between both teaching aids (VR: 34.2%; OB: 34.1%). The answering speed for correctly answered questions in the OB group was approx. twice as high as for the VR group (mean value OB: 98 s, range: 2–410 s; VR: 50 s, 1–290 s). There was a significant difference between the students of the two schools based on a longer processing time in the OB condition in School B (mean OB in School A: 158 s; OB in School B: 77 s). The subjective survey on the learning methods showed a significantly better satisfaction for VR (p = 0.012). Medical career aspirations have been strengthened with VR, while interest of the OB group in such a career tended to decline. The immersive anatomy atlas helped to actively and intuitively perform targeted actions that led to correct answers in a shorter amount of time, even without prior knowledge of VR and anatomy. With the OB method, orientation difficulties and/or the technical effort in the handling of the topographical anatomy atlas seem to lead to a significantly longer response time, especially if the students are not specially trained in literature research in books or texts. This seems to indicate that the VR environment in the sense of constructivist learning might be a more intuitive and effective way to acquire knowledge than from books. © Copyright © 2018 Weyhe, Uslar, Weyhe, Kaluschke and Zachmann.},

abstract={We contribute a new library, DynCam, for real-time, low latency, streaming point cloud processing with a special focus on telepresence in VR. Our library combines several RGBD-images from multiple distributed sources to a single point cloud and transfers it through a network. This processing is organized as a pipeline that supports implicit multithreading. The pipeline uses functional reactive programming to describe transformations on the data in a declarative way. In contrast to previous libraries, DynCam is platform independent, modular and lightweight. This makes it easy to extend and allows easy integration into existing applications. We have prototypically implemented a telepresence application in the Unreal Engine. Our results show that DynCam outperforms competing libraries concerning latency as well as network traffic. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={We present UnrealHaptics, a novel set of plugins that enable both 3-DOF and 6-DOF haptic rendering in the Unreal Engine 4. The core is the combination of the integration of a state-of-the-art collision detection library with support for very fast and stable force and torque computations and a general haptics library for the communication with different haptic hardware devices. Our modular and lightweight architecture makes it easy for other researchers to adapt our plugins to their own requirements. As a use case we have tested our plugin in a new asymmetric collaborative multiplayer game for blind and sighted people. The results show that our plugin easily meets the requirements for haptic rendering even in complex scenes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={There is an increasing trend towards market-driven resource allocation in cloud computing, which can address customer requirements for flexibility, fine-grained allocation, as well as improve provider revenues. We formulate the cloud resource allocation as a double combinatorial auction. However, combinatorial auctions are NP-hard problems. Determining the allocation optimally is thus intractable in most cases. Various heuristics have been proposed, but their performance and quality of the obtained solutions are highly dependent on the input. In this paper, we perform an extensive empirical comparison of several approximate allocation algorithms for double combinatorial auctions. We discuss their performance, economic efficiency, and the reasons behind the observed variations in approximation quality. Finally, we show that there is no clear winner: No algorithm outperforms the others in all test scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel artificial input generator for combinatorial auctions which uses parameterized random distributions for bundle sizes, resource type selection inside a bundle, and the bid values and reserve prices. We showcase its flexibility, required for thorough benchmark design, through a wide range of test cases. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many virtual and mixed reality games focus on single player experiences. In this paper, we describe the concept and prototype implementation of a mixed reality multiplayer game that can be played with a smartphone and an HMD in outdoor environments. Players can team up to fight against attacking alien drones. The relative positions between the players are tracked using GPS, and the rear camera of the smartphone is used to augment the environment and teammates with virtual objects. The combination of multiplayer, mixed reality, the use of geographical location and outdoor action together with affordable, mobile equipment enables a novel strategic and social game experience. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We present a novel method to define the penetration volume between a surface point cloud and arbitrary 3D CAD objects. Moreover, we have developed a massively-parallel algorithm to compute this penetration measure efficiently on the GPU. The main idea is to represent the CAD object's volume by an inner bounding volume hierarchy while the point cloud does not require any additional data structures. Consequently, our algorithm is perfectly suited for streaming point clouds that can be gathered online via depth sensors like the Kinect. We have tested our algorithm in several demanding scenarios and our results show that our algorithm is fast enough to be applied to 6-DOF haptic rendering while computing continuous forces and torques. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel statistical shape descriptor for arbitrary threedimensional shapes as a six-dimensional feature for generic classification purposes. Our feature parameterizes the complete geometrical relation of the global shape and additionally considers local dissimilarities while being invariant to the shape appearance. Our approach allows the classification of large-scale shapes with only small local dissimilarities. Our feature can be easily quantized and mapped into a histogram, which can be used for efficient and effective classification. We take advantage of GPU processing in order to efficiently compute our invariant local shape descriptor feature even for large-scale shapes. Our synthetic benchmarks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for local shape dissimilarity classification. In general, it yields robust and promising recognition rates even for noisy data. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={We present a novel approach for approximating objective functions in arbitrary deterministic and stochastic multi-objective blackbox simulations. Usually, simulated-based optimization approaches require pre-defined objective functions for optimization techniques in order to find a local or global minimum of the specified simulation objectives and multi-objective constraints. Due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art simulations, such objective functions are not always available, leading to so-called blackbox simulations. In contrast to existing approaches, we approximate the objective functions and design space for deterministic and stochastic blackbox simulations, even for convex and concave Pareto fronts, thus enabling optimization for arbitrary simulations. Additionally, Pareto gradient information can be obtained from our design space approximation. Our approach gains its efficiency from a novel gradient-based sampling of the parameter space in combination with a density-based clustering of sampled objective function values, resulting in a B-spline surface approximation of the feasible design space. We have applied our new method to several benchmarks and the results show that our approach is able to efficiently approximate arbitrary objective functions. Additionally, the computed multi-objective solutions in our evaluation studies are close to the Pareto front. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Computer-assisted surgery has pervaded the operating room (OR). While display and imaging technologies advance rapidly, keyboard and mouse are still the dominant input devices, even though they cause sterility problems. We present an interactive virtual operating room (IVOR), intended as a tool to develop and study interaction methods for the OR, and two novel touch-free interaction techniques using hand and foot gestures. All was developed and evaluated with 20 surgeons. The results show that our techniques can be used with minimal learning time and no significant differences regarding completion time and usability compared to the control condition relying on verbal instruction of an assistant. Furthermore, IVOR as a tool was well received by the surgeons, although they had no prior experience with virtual reality. This confirms IVOR is an effective tool for user-centered design and evaluation, providing a portable, yet realistic substitution for a real OR for early evaluations.

abstract={We define a novel geometric predicate and a class of objects that enables us to prove a linear bound on the number of intersecting polygon pairs for colliding 3D objects in that class. Our predicate is relevant both in theory and in practice: it is easy to check and it needs to consider only the geometric properties of the individual objects – it does not depend on the configuration of a given pair of objects. In addition, it characterizes a practically relevant class of objects: we checked our predicate on a large database of real-world 3D objects and the results show that it holds for all but the most pathological ones. Our proof is constructive in that it is the basis for a novel collision detection algorithm that realizes this linear complexity also in practice. Additionally, we present a parallelization of this algorithm with a worst-case running time that is independent of the number of polygons. Our algorithm is very well suited not only for rigid but also for deformable and even topology-changing objects, because it does not require any complex data structures or pre-processing. We have implemented our algorithm on the GPU and the results show that it is able to find in real-time all colliding polygons for pairs of deformable objects consisting of more than 200k triangles, including self-collisions. © 2017 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

abstract={Currently, interest in space missions to small bodies (e.g., asteroids) is increasing, both scientifically and commercially. One of the important aspects of these missions is to test the navigation, guidance, and control algorithms. The most cost and time efficient way to do this is to simulate the missions in virtual testbeds. To do so, a physically-based simulation of the small bodies' physical properties is essential. One of the most important physical properties, especially for landing operations, is the gravitational field, which can be quite irregular, depending on the shape and mass distribution of the body. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to simulate gravitational fields for small bodies like asteroids. The main idea is to represent the small body's mass by a polydisperse sphere packing. This allows for an easy and efficient parallelization. Our GPU-based implementation outperforms traditional methods by more than two orders of magnitude while achieving a similar accuracy. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We define a novel geometric predicate and a class of objects that enables us to prove a linear bound on the number of intersecting polygon pairs for colliding 3D objects in that class. Our predicate is relevant both in theory and in practice: it is easy to check and it needs to consider only the geometric properties of the individual objects - it does not depend on the configuration of a given pair of objects. In addition, it characterizes a practically relevant class of objects: we checked our predicate on a large database of real-world 3D objects and the results show that it holds for all but the most pathological ones. Our proof is constructive in that it is the basis for a novel collision detection algorithm that realizes this linear complexity also in practice. Additionally, we present a parallelization of this algorithm with a worst-case running time that is independent of the number of polygons. Our algorithm is very well suited not only for rigid but also for deformable and even topology-changing objects, because it does not require any complex data structures or pre-processing. We have implemented our algorithm on the GPU and the results show that it is able to find in real-time all colliding polygons for pairs of deformable objects consisting of more than 200k triangles, including self-collisions. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We consider the problem of finding automatically optimal positions of surgical lamps throughout the whole surgical procedure, where we assume that future lamps could be robotized. We propose a two-tiered optimization technique for the real-time autonomous positioning of those robotized surgical lamps. Typically, finding optimal positions for surgical lamps is a multi-dimensional problem with several, in part conicting, objectives, such as optimal lighting conditions at every point in time while minimizing the movement of the lamps in order to avoid distractions of the surgeon. Consequently, we use multi-objective optimization (MOO) to find optimal positions in real-time during the entire surgery. Due to the conicting objectives, there is usually not a single optimal solution for such kinds of problems, but a set of solutions that realizes a Pareto-front. When our algorithm selects a solution from this set it additionally has to consider the individual preferences of the surgeon. This is a highly non-trivial task because the relationship between the solution and the parameters is not obvious. We have developed a novel meta-optimization that considers exactly this challenge. It delivers an easy to understand set of presets for the parameters and allows a balance between the lamp movement and lamp obstruction. This metaoptimization can be pre-computed for different kinds of operations and it then used by our online optimization for the selection of the appropriate Pareto solution. Both optimization approaches use data obtained by a depth camera that captures the surgical site but also the environment around the operating table. We have evaluated our algorithms with data recorded during a real open abdominal surgery. It is available for use for scientific purposes. The results show that our meta-optimization produces viable parameter sets for different parts of an intervention even when trained on a small portion of it. © 2017 SPIE.},

abstract={In the past, the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern has become a major design pattern used in modern architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (RIS). In this paper we introduce high performance wait-free hash maps for the System access of Components within the ECS pattern. This allows non-locking read and write operations, leading to a highly responsive low-latency data access while maintaining a consistent data state. Furthermore, we present centralized as well as decentralized approaches for reducing the memory demand of these memory-intensive wait-free hash maps for diverse RIS applications. Our approaches gain their efficiency by Component-wise queues which use atomic markup operations for fast memory deletion. We have implemented our new method in a current RIS and the results show that our approach is able to efficiently reduce the memory usage of wait-free hash maps very effectively by more than a factor of ten while still maintaining their high performance. Furthermore, we derive best practices from our numerical results for different use cases of wait-free hash map memory management in diverse RIS applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A primary challenge in the automotive industry is the continued increasing complexity of modern cars caused by the ever increasing amount of complex vehicle functions. These functions are implemented as mechatronic systems consisting of multiple individual components. A promising, relatively new approach to manage the increasing complexity in the development process is the function-oriented design that focuses on the interdisciplinary, holistic development of such functions. A frequent and important task in function-oriented design is the identification of the spatial distribution of the components and their connections of a specific function. In this paper, we present a very time-efficient and accurate solution to this task. Our solution uses virtual reality 3D visualization methods, based on consistent integration of function-oriented data with CAD data. We evaluated our method in several user studies and the results show that it is capable of fulfilling the task in a much more a time-efficient and more accurate way than the traditional method. © 2016 CAD Solutions, LLC.},

abstract={We present a novel knowledge discovery approach for automatic feasible design space approximation and parameter optimization in arbitrary multiobjective blackbox simulations. Our approach does not need any supervision of simulation experts. Usually simulation experts conduct simulation experiments for a predetermined system specification by manually reducing the complexity and number of simulation runs by varying input parameters through educated assumptions and according to prior defined goals. This leads to a error-prone trial-and-error approach for determining suitable parameters for successful simulations. In contrast, our approach autonomously discovers unknown relationships in model behavior and approximates the feasible design space. Furthermore, we show how Pareto gradient information can be obtained from this design space approximation for state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Our approach gains its efficiency from a novel spline-based sampling of the parameter space in combination within novel forest-based simulation dataflow analysis. We have applied our new method to several artificial and real-world scenarios and the results show that our approach is able to discover relationships between parameters and simulation goals. Additionally, the computed multiobjective solutions are close to the Pareto front. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We present a new graph-based approach called GraphPool for the generation, management and distribution of simulation states for 3D simulation applications. Currently, relational databases are often used for this task in simulation applications. In contrast, our approach combines novel wait-free nested hash map techniques with traditional graphs which results in a schema-less, in-memory, highly efficient data management. Our GraphPool stores static and dynamic parts of a simulation model, distributes changes caused by the simulation and logs the simulation run. Even more, the GraphPool supports sophisticated query types of traditional relational databases. As a consequence, our GraphPool overcomes the associated drawbacks of relational database technology for sophisticated 3D simulation applications. Our GraphPool has several advantages compared to other state-of-the-art decentralized methods, such as persistence for simulation state over time, object identification, standardized interfaces for software components as well as a consistent world model for the overall simulation system. We tested our approach in a synthetic benchmark scenario but also in real-world use cases. The results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art relational databases by several orders of magnitude. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={For both visual analysis and computer assisted diagnosis systems in breast MRI reading, the delineation and diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is among the most challenging tasks. Recent studies show that kinetic features derived from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) are less effective in discriminating malignant non-masses against benign ones due to their similar kinetic characteristics. Adding shape descriptors can improve the differentiation accuracy. In this work, we propose a set of novel morphological features using the sphere packing technique, aiming to discriminate non-masses based on their shapes. The feature extraction, selection and the classification modules are integrated into a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The evaluation was performed on a data set of 106 non-masses extracted from 86 patients, which achieved an accuracy of 90.56%, precision of 90.3%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.94 for the differentiation of benign and malignant types. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={Vision-based markerless hand tracking hasmany applications, for instance in virtual prototyping, navigation in virtual environments, tele- and robot-surgery and video games. It is a very challenging task, due to the real-time requirements, 26 degrees-of-freedom, high appearance variability, and frequent self-occlusions. Because of that, and because of the many desirable applications, it has received increasing attention in the computer vision community of the past years. A lot of approaches have been proposed to (partially) solve the problem, but no system has been presented yet that can solve the full-DOF hand pose estimation problem robustly in real-time. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the approaches that have been presented so far and where future research of hand tracking probably will go. First, we will explain the challenges in more detail. Second, we will classify the approaches; third,we will describe themost important approaches, and finally we will show the future directions and give a short overview of our current work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Modelling, simulation, and optimization play a crucial role in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles. The ability to compute, test, assess, and debug suitable configurations reduces the time and cost of vehicle development. Until now, engineers are forced to manually change vehicle configurations in virtual testbeds in order to react to inappropriate simulated vehicle performance. Such manual adjustments are very time consuming and are also often made ad-hoc, which decreases the overall quality of the vehicle engineering process. In order to avoid this manual adjustment as well as to improve the overall quality of these adjustments, we present a novel comprehensive approach to modelling, simulation, and optimization of such vehicles. Instead of manually adjusting vehicle configurations, engineers can specify simulation goals in a domain specific modelling language. The simulated vehicle performance is then mapped to these simulation goals and our multi-agent system computes for optimized vehicle configuration parameters in order to satisfy these goals. Consequently, our approach does not need any supervision and gives engineers visual feedback of their vehicle configuration expectations. Our evaluation shows that we are able to optimize vehicle configuration sets to meet simulation goals while maintaining real-time performance of the overall simulation. © 2015 European Alliance for Innovation.

abstract={A central part of virtual reality systems and game engines is the generation, management and distribution of all relevant world states. In modern interactive graphic software systems usually many independent software components need to communicate and exchange data. Standard approaches suffer the n2 problem because the number of interfaces grows quadratically with the number of component functionalities. Such many-to-many architectures quickly become unmaintainable, not to mention latencies of standard concurrency control mechanisms. We present a novel method to manage concurrent multithreaded access to shared data in virtual environments. Our highly efficient low-latency and lightweight architecture is based on a new wait-free hash map using key-value pairs. This allows us to reduce the traditional many-to-many problem to a simple many-to-one approach. Our results show that our framework outperforms by more than two orders of magnitude standard lock-based but also modern lock-free methods significantly.},

abstract={We present a novel concurrency control mechanism for col- laborative massively parallel virtual environments that al- lows an arbitrary amount of components to exchange data with very little synchronisation overhead. The approach taken here is to maintain the shared world state of the com- plete virtual environment in a global key-value pool. Our novel method does not use any locking mechanism. Instead it allows wait-free data access for all concurrent components for both, reading and writing operations. This guarantees a highly responsive low-latency data access while keeping a consistent system state for all users and system compo- nents. Nevertheless, our approach is perfectly scalable even for massive multi-user scenarios. We provide a number of benchmarks in this paper, and the results show an almost constant run-Time, independent of the number of concur- rent users. Moreover, our approach outperforms previous concurrency control systems significantly by more than an order of magnitude. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Problems and the calculation of trajectory sensitivities for on-board stability analysis as well as real-time optimal control are explained. Bringing cognitive autonomy to a spacecraft requires an on-board computational module as a central spacecraft component. This module is responsible for state evaluation, mission planning and decision-making regarding selection of potential targets, trajectory selection and FD1R. A knowledge-base serves as a database for decision making processes. With the aim to validate and test our methods, we create a virtual environment in which humans can interact with the simulation of the mission. In order to achieve real-time performance, we propose a massively-parallel software system architecture, which enables very efficient and easily adaptable communication between concurrent software modules within KaNaRiA.,With the rapid evolution of space technologies and increasing thirst for knowledge about the origin of life and the universe, the need for deep space missions as well as for autonomous solutions for complex, time-critical mission operations becomes urgent. Within this context, the project KaNaRiA aims at technology development tailored to the ambitious task of space resource mining on small planetary bodies using increased autonomy for on-board mission planning, navigation and guidance. This paper focuses on the specific challenges as well as first solutions and results corresponding to the KaNaRiA mission phases (1) interplanetary cruise, (2) target identification and characterization and (3) proximity operations. Based on the KaNaRiA asteroid mining mission objectives, initially, a mission reference scenario as well as a reference mission architecture are described in this paper. KaNaRiA has been proposed as a multi-spacecraft mission to the asteroid main belt. Composed of a flock of prospective scout spacecraft, a mother ship carrying the mining payload and several service modules placed on a 2.8 AU parking orbit around the Sun, KaNaRiA intends to characterize main belt asteroid properties, identify targets for mining and perform a soft-landing for in-situ characterization and mining. Subsequently, the autonomous navigation system design of KaNaRiA for the interplanetary cruise is presented. The navigation challenges, which arise in phases (1) to (3), are discussed. Particular attention is given to the sensor- technology readiness-level, accuracy, applicability range, mass and power budgets. In order to navigate in the vicinity of an asteroid, an information fusion algorithm is required that aggregates multi-sensor data as well as a- priori knowledge and solves the task known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In order to deal with uncertain and inconsistent information and to explicitly represent different dimensions of uncertainty, a belief- function-based SLAM approach is used, which is a generalization of the popular FastSLAM algorithm. The objective of the guidance task is the autonomous planning of optimal transfer trajectories according to mission driving criteria, e.g. transfer time and fuel consumption.

abstract={The 2013 IEEE Scientific Visualization Contest focused on developmental neuroscience related to the mouse brain. In developmental neuroscience, researchers examine spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression to understand how brain structures evolve and vary over an organism's life. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas project generated expression data for thousands of genes with high spatial resolution over multiple developmental stages. These data have become an invaluable resource for neuroscientists and developmental biologists exploring interesting spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. Given the extremely large amounts of data, it's desirable to apply visualization techniques to their access, analysis, and interpretation. The proposed visual-analytics system enables clear, insightful observations of the gene expression patterns for such data, focusing on structural patterns that vary across gene expression levels over six developmental stages. Users can explore patterns through specialized data-driven representations that capture emerging structure-function associations in the developing mouse brain. The system also provides an effective characterization of certain processes in the developing brain that could lead to further analysis. © 1981-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A primary challenge in the automotive industry is the increasing complexity of modern cars caused by the high amount of vehicle electronics respectively vehicle functions which are implemented as mechatronic systems. A promising solution is the relatively new function-oriented development approach that focuses on the interdisciplinary development of such functions and which helps to handle the high complexity in automotive development. At this stage, however, a function-oriented development does not fully exploit the capabilities of virtual technologies which are fairly well-established technologies in the automotive product development. One reason in particular is that function-oriented data is not yet integrated with geometric CAD data. The authors' main contributions begin with an analysis of the data structures of function architecture data and CAD data and they provide a definition of the requirements for a consistent mapping of named data structures. Moreover, they also develop a meta-format that enables a system-independent description and exchange of function architectures. In addition, the authors carry out a prototypical implementation that shows the applicability of the proposed data integration approach and they derive new methods that can assist a function-oriented development. Finally, the authors evaluate these methods by means of actual use cases. Summarizing, their research focuses on the interdisciplinary integration of function architectures with CAD models to create synergies and to enable new, beneficial methods for the spatial visualization and utilization of such data. © 2014 CAD Solutions, LLC.},

abstract={Ordinary bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) construction algorithms create BVHs that approximate the boundary of the objects. In this paper, we present a BVH construction that instead approximates the volume of the objects with successively finer levels. It is based on Batch Neural Gas (BNG), a clustering algorithm that is known from machine learning. Additionally, we present a novel massively parallel version of this BNG-based hierarchy construction that runs completely on the GPU. It reduces the theoretical complexity of the sequential algorithm from O(nlogn) to O(log2 n) and also our CUDA implementation outperforms the CPU version significantly in practice. © The Eurographics Association 2014.},

abstract={We present a novel massively-parallel algorithm that allows real-Time distance computations between arbitrary 3D objects and unstructured point cloud data. Our main application scenario is collision avoidance for robots in highly dynamic environments that are recorded via a Kinect, but our algorithm can be easily generalized for other applications such as virtual reality. Basically, we represent the 3D object by a bounding volume hierarchy, therefore we adopted the Inner Sphere Trees data structure, and we process all points of the point cloud in parallel using GPU optimized traversal algorithms. Additionally, all parallel threads share a common upper bound in the minimum distance, this leads to a very high culling efficiency. We implemented our algorithm using CUDA and the results show a real-Time performance for online captured point clouds. Our algorithm outperforms previous CPU-based approaches by more than an order of magnitude. © The Eurographics Association 2014.},

abstract={We prove that the maximum number of intersecting pairs spheres between two sets of polydisperse sphere packings is linear in the worst case. This observation is the basis for a new collision detection algorithm. Our new approach guarantees a linear worst case running time for arbitrary 3D objects. Additionally, we present a parallelization of our new algorithm that runs in constant time, even in the worst case. Consequently, it is perfectly suited for all time-critical environments that allow only a fixed time budget for finding collision. Our implementation using CUDA shows collision detection at haptic rates for complex objects. © 2013 VRIPHYS 2013 - 10th Workshop on Virtual Reality Interactions and Physical Simulations.

abstract={We present the results of a comprehensive user study that evaluates the influence of the degrees of freedom on the users' performance in complex bi-manual haptic interaction tasks. To do that, we have developed a novel multi-player game that allows the qualitative as well as the quantitative evaluation of different force-feedback devices simultaneously. The game closely resembles typical tasks arising in tele-operation scenarios or virtual assembly simulations; thus, the results of our user study apply directly to real-world industrial applications. The game is based on our new haptic workspace that supports high fidelity, two-handed multi-user interactions in scenarios containing a large number of dynamically simulated rigid objects; moreover, it works independent of the objects' polygon count. The results of our user study show that 6 DOF force-feedback devices outperform 3 DOF devices significantly, both in user perception and in user performance. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel geometric data structure for approximate collision detection at haptic rates between rigid objects. Our data structure, which we call inner sphere trees, supports different kinds of queries, namely, proximity queries and the penetration volume, which is related to the water displacement of the overlapping region and, thus, corresponds to a physically motivated force. Moreover, we present a time-critical version of the penetration volume computation that is able to achieve very tight upper and lower bounds within a fixed budget of query time. The main idea is to bound the object from the inside with a bounding volume hierarchy, which can be constructed based on dense sphere packings. In order to build our new hierarchy, we propose to use an AI clustering algorithm, which we extend and adapt here. The results show performance at haptic rates both for proximity and penetration volume queries for models consisting of hundreds of thousands of polygons. © 2011 Springer-Verlag/Wien.},

abstract={We propose a novel, model-based approach for articulated object detection and pose estimation that does not need any low-level feature extraction or foreground segmentation and thus eliminates this error-prone step. Our approach works directly on the input color image and is based on a new kind of divergence of the color distribution between an object hypothesis and its background. Consequently, we get a color distribution of the target object for free. We further propose a coarse-to-fine and hierarchical algorithm for fast object localization and pose estimation. Our approach works significantly better than segmentation-based approaches in cases where the segmentation is noisy or fails, e.g. scenes with skin-colored backgrounds or bad illumination that distorts the skin color.

abstract={We present a benchmarking suite for rigid object collision detection and collision response schemes. The proposed benchmarking suite can evaluate both the performance as well as the quality of the collision response. The former is achieved by densely sampling the configuration space of a large number of highly detailed objects; the latter is achieved by a novel methodology that comprises a number of models for certain collision scenarios. With these models, we compare the force and torque signals both in direction and magnitude. Our device-independent approach allows objective predictions for physically-based simulations as well as 6-DOF haptic rendering scenarios. In the results, we show a comprehensive example application of our benchmarks comparing two quite different algorithms utilizing our proposed benchmarking suite. This proves empirically that our methodology can become a standard evaluation framework. Copyright © 2010 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel, fast, resolution-independent silhouette area-based matching approach. We approximate the silhouette area by a small set of axis-aligned rectangles. This yields a very memory efficient representation of templates. In addition, utilizing the integral image, we can thus compare a silhouette with an input image at an arbitrary position in constant time. Furthermore, we present a new method to build a template hierarchy optimized for our rectangular representation of template silhouettes. With the template hierarchy, the complexity of our matching method for n templates is O(logn). For example, we can match a hierarchy consisting of 1000 templates in 1.5 ms. Overall, our contribution constitutes an important piece in the initialization stage of any tracker of (articulated) objects. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={We present a novel geometric data structure for approximate collision detection at haptic rates between rigid objects. Our data structure, which we call inner sphere trees, supports both proximity queries and the penetration volume; the latter is related to the water displacement of the overlapping region and, thus, corresponds to a physically motivated force. Moreover, we present a multi-threaded version of the penetration volume computation for time-critical haptic rendering that is based on separation lists and the novel notion of expected overlapping volumes. Finally, we show how to use the penetration volume to compute continuous contact forces and torques that enable a stable rendering of 6-DOF penalty-based distributed contacts. The main idea of our new data structure is to bound the object from the inside with a bounding volume hierarchy, which can be built based on dense sphere packings. In order to construct an efficient hierarchy, we propose to use an AI clustering algorithm, which we extend and adapt here. The results show performance at haptic rates both for proximity and penetration volume queries for models consisting of hundreds of thousands of polygons. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.},

abstract={Template matching is a well-proven approach in the area of articulated object tracking. Matching accuracy and computation time of template matching are essential and yet often conflicting goals. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive template matching approach based on the silhouette area of the articulated object. With our approach, the ratio between accuracy and speed simply is a modifiable parameter, and, even at high accuracy, it is still faster than a state-of-the-art approach. We approximate the silhouette area by a small set of axis-aligned rectangles. Utilizing the integral image, we can thus compare a silhouette with an input image at an arbitrary position independently of the resolution of the input image. In addition, our rectangle covering yields a very memory efficient representation of templates. Furthermore, we present a new method to build a template hierarchy optimized for our rectangular representation of template silhouettes. With the template hierarchy, the complexity of our matching method for n templates is O(logn) and independent of the input resolution. For example, a set of 3000 templates can be matched in 2.3 ms. Overall, our novel methods are an important contribution to a complete system for tracking articulated objects. © 2010. The copyright of this document resides with its authors.},

abstract={We present a novel geometric data structure for approximate collision detection at haptic rates between rigid objects. Our data structure, which we call inner sphere trees, supports both proximity queries and the penetration volume; the latter is related to the water displacement of the overlapping region and, thus, corresponds to a physically motivated force. Moreover, we present a multi-threaded version of the penetration volume computation for time-critical haptic rendering that is based on separation lists and the novel notion of expected overlapping volumes. Finally, we show how to use the penetration volume to compute continuous contact forces and torques that enable a stable rendering of 6-DOF penalty-based distributed contacts. The main idea of our new data structure is to bound the object from the inside with a bounding volume hierarchy, which can be built based on dense sphere packings. In order to construct an efficient hierarchy, we propose to use an AI clustering algorithm, which we extend and adapt here. The results show performance at haptic rates both for proximity and penetration volume queries for models consisting of hundreds of thousands of polygons. © 2009 by ASME.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel edge gradient based template matching method for object detection. In contrast to other methods, ours does not perform any binarization or discretization during the online matching. This is facilitated by a new continuous edge gradient similarity measure. Its main components are a novel edge gradient operator, which is applied to query and template images, and the formulation as a convolution, which can be computed very efficiently in Fourier space. We compared our method to a state-of-the-art chamfer based matching method. The results demonstrate that our method is much more robust against weak edge response and yields much better confidence maps with fewer maxima that are also more significant. In addition, our method lends itself well to efficient implementation on GPUs: at a query image resolution of 320 x 256 and a template resolution of 80 x 80 we can generate about 330 confidence maps per second.},

abstract={Diagnostic algorithms and efficient visualization techniques are of major importance for preoperative decisions, intra-operative imaging and image-guided surgery. Complex diagnostic decisions are characterized by a high information flow and fast decisions, requiring efficient and intuitive presentation of complex medical data and precision in the visualization. For intra-operative medical treatment, the pre-operative visualization results of the diagnostic systems have to be transferred to the patient on the operation room table. Via augmented reality, additional information of the hidden regions can be displayed virtually. This state-of-the-art report summarizes visual computing algorithms for medical diagnosis and treatment. After starting with direct volume rendering and tagged volume rendering as general techniques for visualizing anatomical structures, we go into more detail by focusing on the visualization of tissue and vessel structures. Afterwards, algorithms and techniques that are used for medical treatment in the context of image-guided surgery, intra-operative imaging and augmented reality are discussed and reviewed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to detect homogeneous color regions in images. We show its performance by applying it to skin detection. In contrast to previously presented methods, we use only a rough skin direction vector instead of a static skin model as a priori knowledge. Thus, higher robustness is achieved in images captured under unconstrained conditions. We formulate the segmentation as a clustering problem in color space. A homogeneous color region in image space is modeled using a 3D gaussian distribution. Parameters of the gaussians are estimated using the EM algorithm with spatial constraints. We transform the image by a whitening transform and then apply a fuzzy k-means algorithm to the hue value in order to obtain initialization parameters for the EM algorithm. A divisive hierarchical approach is used to determine the number of clusters. The stopping criterion for further subdivision is based on the edge image. For evaluation, the proposed method is applied to skin segmentation and compared with a well known method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={We present a new acceleration scheme for continuous collision detection of objects under arbitrary deformations. Both pairwise and self collision detection are presented. This scheme is facilitated by a new acceleration data structure, the kinetic separation list. The event-based approach of our kinetic separation list enables us to transform the continuous problem into a discrete one. Thus, the number of updates of the bounding volume hierarchies as well as the number of bounding volume checks can be reduced significantly. We performed a comparison of our kinetic approaches with the classical swept volume algorithm. The results show that our algorithm performs up to fifty times faster in practically relevant scenarios. © The Eurographics Association 2006.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a model to estimate the expected running time of hierarchical collision detection that utilizes AABB trees, which are a frequently used type of bounding volume (BV). We show that the average running time for the simultaneous traversal of two binary AABB trees depends on two characteristic parameters: the overlap of the root BVs and the BV diminishing factor within the hierarchies. With this model, we show that the average running time is in O(n) or even in O(logn) for realistic cases. Finally, we present some experiments that confirm our theoretical considerations. We believe that our results are interesting not only from a theoretical point of view, but also for practical applications, e. g., in time-critical collision detection scenarios where our running time prediction could help to make the best use of CPU time available. © The Eurographics Association 2006.},

abstract={A novel approach for highly space-efficient hardware-accelerated collision detection is presented. This paper focuses on the architecture to traverse bounding volume hierarchies in hardware. It is based on a novel algorithm for testing discretely oriented polytopes (DOPs) for overlap, utilizing only fixed-point (i.e., integer) arithmetic. We derive a bound on the deviation from the mathematically correct result and give formal proof that no false negatives are produced. Simulation results show that real-time collision detection of complex objects at rates required by force-feedback and physicallybased simulations can be obtained. In addition, synthesis results prove the architecture to be highly space efficient. We compare our FPGA-optimized design with a fully parallelized ASIC-targeted architecture and a software implementation. Copyright © UNION Agency - Science Press.},

abstract={We present a space-efficient, FPGA-optimized architecture to detect collisions among virtual objects. The design consists of two main modules, one for traversing a hierarchical acceleration data structure, and one for intersecting triangles. This paper focuses on the former. The design is based on a novel algorithm for testing discretely oriented polytopes for overlap in 3D space. In addition, we derive a new overlap test algorithm that can be implemented using fixed-point arithmetic without producing false negatives and with bounded error. SystemC simulation results on different levels of abstraction show that real-time collision detection of complex objects at rates required by force-feedback and physically-based simulations can be obtained. In addition, synthesis results show that the design can still be fitted into a sixmillion gates FPGA. Furthermore, we compare our FPGA-based design with a fully parallelized ASIC-targeted architecture and a software implementation.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for parallel sorting on stream processing architectures. It is based on adaptive bitonic sorting. For sorting n values utilizing p stream processor units, this approach achieves the optimal time complexity O((n log n)/p). While this makes our approach competitive with common sequential sorting algorithms not only from a theoretical viewpoint, it is also very fast from a practical viewpoint. This is achieved by using efficient linear stream memory accesses (and by combining the optimal time approach with algorithms optimized for small input sequences). We present an implementation on modern programmable graphics hardware (GPUs). On recent GPUs, our optimal parallel sorting approach has shown to be remarkably faster than sequential sorting on the CPU, and it is also faster than previous non-optimal sorting approaches on the GPU for sufficiently large input sequences. Because of the excellent scalability of our algorithm with the number of stream processor units p (up to n/ log2 n or even n/log n units, depending on the stream architecture), our approach profits heavily from, the trend of increasing number of fragment processor units on GPUs, so that we can expect further speed improvement with upcoming GPU generations. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Collision detection is an enabling technology for many virtual environments, games, and virtual prototyping applications containing some kind of physically-based simulation (such as rigid bodies, cloth, surgery, etc.). The persistent interest in collision detection by both academia and industry is due to the large variety of applications as well as new challenges in new application domains, such as virtual clothes fitting. This tutorial will give an overview of the different classes of algorithms, and then provide attendees with in-depth knowledge of some of the important algorithms within each class, focusing in particular on recent approaches, such as stochastic methods or image-space techniques. Attendees will learn to select the one most appropriate for their application, and implement it with only very little further research. The intended audience are practitioners and students working in 3D computer graphics. Topics to be addressed hierarchical collision detection stochastic methods distance fields spatial subdivisions image-space techniques continuous collision detection non-polygonal object representations (e.g., point clouds).},

abstract={We present a novel algorithm to compute intersections of two point clouds. It can be used to detect collisions between implicit surfaces defined by two point sets, or to construct their intersection curves. Our approach utilizes a proximity graph that allows for quick interpolation search of a common zero of the two implicit functions. First, pairs of points from one point set are constructed, bracketing the intersection with the other surface. Second, an interpolation search along shortest paths in the graph is performed. Third, the solutions are refined. For the first and third step, randomized sampling is utilized. We show that the number of evaluations of the implicit function and the overall runtime is in O(log logN), where N is the point cloud size. The storage is bounded by O(N). Our measurements show that we achieve a speedup by an order of magnitude compared to a recently proposed randomized sampling technique for point cloud collision detection.

abstract={We present a hardware architecture for a single-chip acceleration of an efficient hierarchical collision detection algorithm as well as simulation results for collision queries using this architecture. The architecture consists of two main stages, one for traversing simultaneously a hierarchy of discretely oriented poly topes, and one for intersecting triangles. Within each stage, the architecture is deeply pipelined and parallelized. For the first stage, we compare and evaluate different traversal schemes for bounding volume hierarchies. A simulation in VHDL shows that a hardware implementation can offer a speed-up over a software implementation by orders of magnitude. Thus, real-time collision detection of complex objects at rates required by force-feedback and physically-based simulations can be achieved.},

abstract={We propose a model to analyze the expected running time of hierarchical collision detection that utilizes bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). It depends on two characteristic parameters: the overlap of the root BVs and the BV diminishing factor within the hierarchies. We show that the average running time is in O(n) or even in O(logn) for realistic cases, where n is the number of leaves. Our theoretical analysis is verified by practical experiments.},

abstract={Interactive environments for dynamically deforming objects play an important role in surgery simulation and entertainment technology. These environments require fast deformable models and very efficient collision handling techniques. While collision detection for rigid bodies is well investigated, collision detection for deformable objects introduces additional challenging problems. This paper focuses on these aspects and summarizes recent research in the area of deformable collision detection. Various approaches based on bounding volume hierarchies, distance fields and spatial partitioning are discussed. In addition, image-space techniques and stochastic methods are considered. Applications in cloth modeling and surgical simulation are presented. © The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel calibration method for datagloves with many degrees of freedom 1. The goal of our method is to establish a mapping from the sensor values of the glove to the joint angles of an articulated hand that is of 'high visual' fidelity. This is in contrast to previous methods that aim at determining the absolute values of the real joint angles with high accuracy. The advantage of our method is that it can be simply carried through without the need for auxiliary calibration hardware (such as cameras), while still producing visually correct mappings. To achieve this, we developed a method that explicitly models the cross-couplings of the abduction sensors with the neighboring flex sensors. The results show that our method performs superior to linear calibration in most cases.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new method that can consistently orient all normals of any mesh (if at all possible), while ensuring that most polygons are seen with their front-faces from most viewpoints. Our algorithm combines the proximity-based with a new visibility-based approach. Thus, it virtually eliminates the problems of proximity-based approaches, while avoiding the limitations of previous solid-based approaches. Our new method builds a connectivity graph of the patches of the model, which encodes the "proximity" of neighboring patches. In addition, it augments this graph with two visibility coefficients far each patch. Based on this graph, a global consistent orientation of all patches is quickly found by a greedy optimization. We have tested our new method with a large suite of models, many of which from the automotive industry. The results show that almost all models can be oriented consistently and sensibly using our new algorithm.},

abstract={We present a new definition of an implicit surface over a noisy point cloud, based on the weighted least-squares approach. It can be evaluated very fast, but artifacts are significantly reduced. We propose to use a different kernel function that approximates geodesic distances on the surface by utilizing a geometric proximity graph. From a variety of possibilities, we have examined the Delaunay graph and the sphere-of-influence graph (SIG), for which we propose several extensions. The proximity graph also allows us to estimate the local sampling density, which we utilize to automatically adapt the bandwidth of the kernel and to detect boundaries. Consequently, our method is able to handle point clouds of varying sampling density without manual tuning. Our method can be integrated into other surface definitions, such as moving least squares, so that these benefits carry over. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the past few years, many efficient rendering and surface reconstruction algorithms for point clouds have been developed. However, collision detection of point clouds has not been considered until now, although this is a prerequisite to use them for interactive or animated 3D graphics. We present a novel approach for time-critical collision detection of point clouds. Based solely on the point representation, it can detect intersections of the underlying implicit surfaces. The surfaces do not need to be closed. We construct a point hierarchy where each node stores a sufficient sample of the points plus a sphere covering of a part of the surface. These are used to derive criteria that guide our hierarchy traversal so as to increase convergence. One of them can be used to prune pairs of nodes, the other one is used to prioritize still to be visited pairs of nodes. At the leaves we efficiently determine an intersection by estimating the smallest distance. We have tested our implementation for several large point cloud models. The results show that a very fast and precise answer to collision detection queries can always be given.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel, hardwareaccelerated approach to compute the visibility between surface points and directional light sources. Thus, our method provides a first-order approximation of the rendering equation in graphics hardware. This is done by accumulating depth tests of vertex fragments as seen from a number of light directions. Our method does not need any preprocessing of the scene elements and introduces no memory overhead. Besides of the handling of large polygonal models, it is suitable for deformable or animated objects under time-varying high-dynamic range illumination at interactive frame rates.},

abstract={We present a novel, generic framework and algorithm for hierarchical collision detection, which allows an application to balance speed and quality of the collision detection. We pursue an average-case approach that yields a numerical measure of the quality. This can either be specified by the simulation or interaction, or it can help to assess the result of the collision detection in a time-critical system. Conceptually, we consider sets of polygons during traversal and estimate probabilities that there is an intersection among these sets. This can be done efficiently by storing characteristics about the average distribution of the set of polygons with each node in a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). Consequently, we neither need any polygon intersection tests nor access to any polygons during the collision detection process. Our approach can be applied to virtually any BVH. Therefore, we call a BVH that has been augmented in this way an average-distribution tree or ADB-tree. We have implemented our new approach with two basic BVHs and present performance measurements and comparisons with a very fast previous algorithm, namely the DOPtree. The results show a speedup of about a factor 3 to 6 with only approximately 4% error. Copyright © 2003 ACM.},

abstract={We present a novel bounding volume hierarchy that allows for extremely small data structure sizes while still performing collision detection as fast as other classical hierarchical algorithms in most cases. The hierarchical data structure is a variation of axis-aligned bounding box trees. In addition to being very memory efficient, it can be constructed efficiently and very fast. We also propose a criterion to be used during the construction of the BV hierarchies is more formally established than previous heuristics. The idea of the argument is general and can be applied to other bounding volume hierarchies as well. Furthermore, we describe a general optimization technique that can be applied to most hierarchical collision detection algorithms. Finally, we describe several box overlap tests that exploit the special features of our new BV hierarchy. These are compared experimentally among each other and with the DOP tree using a benchmark suite of real-world CAD data.},

abstract={Business process re-engineering is becoming a main focus in today's efforts to overcome problems and deficits in the automotive and aerospace industries (e.g., integration in international markets, product complexity, increasing number of product variants, reduction in product development time and cost). In this paper, we investigate the steps needed to apply virtual reality (VR) for virtual prototyping (VP) to verify assembly and maintenance processes. After a review of today's business process in vehicle prototyping, we discuss CAD-VR data integration and identify new requirements for design quality. We present several new interaction paradigms so that engineers and designers can experiment naturally with the prototype. Finally, a user survey evaluates some of the paradigms and the acceptance and feasability of virtual prototyping for our key process. The results show that VR will play an important role for VP in the near future.},

abstract={Based on a general hierarchical data structure, we present a fast algorithm for exact collision detection of arbitrary polygonal rigid objects. Objects consisting of hundreds of thousands of polygons can be checked for collision at interactive rates. The pre-computed hierarchy is a tree of discrete oriented polytopes (DOPs). An efficient way of re-aligning DOPs during traversal of such trees allows to use simple interval tests for determining overlap between DOPs. The data structure is very efficient in terms of memory and construction time. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real-world CAD data have been carried out to analyze the performance and memory usage of the data structure. A comparison with OBB-trees indicates that DOP-trees as efficient in terms of collision query time, and more efficient in memory usage and construction time.},

abstract={Electro-magnetic tracking systems are in wide-spread use for measuring 6D positions. However, their accuracy is impaired seriously by distortions of the magnetic fields caused by many types of metal which are omnipresent at real sites. We present a fast and robust method for 'equalizing' those distortions win order to yield accurate tracking. The algorithm is based on global scattered data interpolation using a 'snap-shot' of the magnetic field's distortion measured once in advance. The algorithm is fast (it does not introduce any further lag in the data flow), robust, the samples of the field's 'snap-shot' can be arranged in any way, and it is easy to implement. The distortion is visualized in an intuitive way to provide insight into its nature, and the correction algorithm is evaluated in terms of accuracy and performance. Finally, a qualitative comparison of the susceptibility of a Polhemus and an Ascension tracking system is carried out.},
