abstract={Tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and its processing involves a number of steps which includes fermentation. Tea fermentation is the most important step in determining the quality of tea. Currently, optimum fermentation of tea is detected by tasters using any of the following methods: monitoring change in color of tea as fermentation progresses and tasting and smelling the tea as fermentation progresses. These manual methods are not accurate. Consequently, they lead to a compromise in the quality of tea. This study proposes a deep learning model dubbed TeaNet based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). The input data to TeaNet are images from the tea Fermentation and Labelme datasets. We compared the performance of TeaNet with other standard machine learning techniques: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB). TeaNet was more superior in the classification tasks compared to the other machine learning techniques. However, we will confirm the stability of TeaNet in the classification tasks in our future studies when we deploy it in a tea factory in Kenya. The research also released a tea fermentation dataset that is available for use by the community. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Despite a large number of applications in the field of health care, military, ecology or agriculture, the Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) faces the problem of wireless Underground Communication (WUC) which largely attenuate the signal on the ground. For the case of precision agriculture, the motes are buried and they have to check the good growth of plants by verifying data like the water content. However, due to soil composition, the wave signal is attenuated as it travels across the ground. Thus, before a real deployment of WUSN, the prediction of the path loss due to signal attenuation underground is an important asset for the good network functioning. In this paper, we proposed a WUSN path loss for precision agriculture called WUSN-PLM. To achieve it, the proposed model is based on an accurate prediction of the Complex Dielectric Constant (CDC). WUSN-PLM allows evaluating the path loss according to the different types of communication (Underground-to-Underground, Underground to Aboveground and Aboveground to Underground). On each communication type, WUSN-PLM takes into account reflective and refractive wave attenuation according to the sensor node burial depth. To evaluate WUSN-PLM, intensive measurements on real sensor nodes with two different pairs of transceivers have been conducted on the botanic garden of the University Cheikh Anta Diop in Senegal. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing path loss models in different communication types. The results show that our proposed approach can be used on real cheap sensor with 87.13% precision and 85% balanced accuracy. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless communication is essential for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in order to provide job instructions, forward sensed data or coordinate multiple AUVs working in a swarm. However, communication in the underwater environment is unreliable and does not allow high data rates due to high interference and poor signal propagation conditions. This article reviews existing concepts for underwater communications both from the information transfer as well as from the networking aspect. Introducing semantic communication helps to reduce the amount of transferred data by making use of semantic side information. Opportunistic networks allow end-to-end data forwarding without permanent connectivity and can be extended to make use of the most suitable communication technology when forwarding data with given size and priority. Machine Learning (ML) helps to remember and classify background information to enhance the efficiency of the communication. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) become an attractive field due to its applications. On these applications, links between nodes are made through wireless underground communication of electromagnetic waves. However, due to soil complexity, the wave signal is attenuated as it travels across the ground. The prediction of the path loss due to signal attenuation across the ground depends on several parameters like soil composition, soil particle sizes, moisture or temperature. Designing an accurate path loss model for WUSNs remains a key issue on Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). In this paper, we proposed a new approach for path loss prediction in WUSNs. In order to achieve it, we firstly analyze the existing path losses in literature. Secondly, we evaluated and compared the Complex Dielectric Constant (CDC) derivation schemes. Thirdly, we proposed a new path loss model that uses a better CDC prediction than the existing path losses. To validate our approach, measurements in real experimental field were made and real sensor nodes are used. The conducted experimentations show that our proposed path loss is more accurate than the existing path loss models with the lowest errors. Furthermore, we show the efficiency of our approach by considering ±3% error of the soil moisture sensor. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A variety of applications and forwarding protocols have been proposed for opportunistic networks (OppNets) in the literature. However, the methodology of evaluation, testing and comparing these forwarding protocols are not standardized yet, which leads to large levels of ambiguity in performance evaluation studies. Performance results depend largely on the evaluation environment, and on the used parameters and models. More comparability in evaluation scenarios and methodologies would largely improve also the availability of protocols and the repeatability of studies, and thus would accelerate the development of this research topic. In this survey paper, we focus our attention on how various OppNets data forwarding protocols are evaluated rather than what they actually achieve. We explore the models, parameters and the evaluation environments and make observations about their scalability, realism and comparability. Finally, we deduce some best practices on how to achieve the largest impact of future evaluation studies of OppNets data dissemination/forwarding protocols. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Risk management is one of the most important facets in the mining industry. Miners working in the underground production areas are exposed to many risks, i.e. extreme environment, toxic gases and rock bursts. Traditional means of communication usually break down in case of a disaster in the mine. Hence, it becomes impossible to find the miners trapped miles under the ground. This work explores the potential of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in the area of the mining industry and in specific, helping the rescuers to find trapped miners in a disaster scenario. A prototype sensor node operating at 433MHz is designed for monitoring the health of the miners and localising them. Disaster scenarios are emulated in a mock mine to evaluate the performance of the developed sensor node against commodity hardware. Initial results show that WSNs operating at 433MHz combat the disaster scenario much better than the traditional WSNs operating at 2.4GHz. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine-type communication (MTC) is an emerging communication trend where intelligent machines are capable of communicating with each other without human intervention. Mobile cellular networks, with their wide range, high data rates, and continuously decreasing costs, offer a good infrastructure for implementing them. However, power consumption is a great issue, which has recently been addressed by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) by defining power-saving mechanisms. In this paper, we address the problem of modeling these power-saving mechanisms. Currently existing modeling schemes do not consider the full range of states in the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism in LTE-A networks. We propose a semi-Markov based analytical model, which closes this gap and shows very good results in terms of predicting performance evaluation metrics, such as the power-saving factor and wake-up latency of MTC devices compared to simulation experiments. Furthermore, we offer an evaluation of the DRX parameters and their impact on power consumption of MTC devices. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Opportunistic networks have recently seen increasing interest in the networking community. They can serve a range of application scenarios, most of them being destination-less, i.e., without a-priori knowledge of who is the final destination of a message. In this paper, we explore the usage of data popularity for improving the efficiency of data forwarding in opportunistic networks. Whether a message will become popular or not is not known before disseminating it to users. Thus, popularity needs to be estimated in a distributed manner considering a local context. We propose KEETCHI, a data forwarding protocol based on Q-Learning to give more preference to popular data rather than less popular data. Our extensive simulation comparison between KEETCHI and the well known EPIDEMIC protocol shows that the network overhead of data forwarding can be significantly reduced while keeping the delivery rate the same. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Long Term Evolution networks, which are cellular networks, are subject to many impairments due to the nature of the transmission channel used, i.e. the air. Intercell interference is the main impairment faced by Long Term Evolution networks as it uses frequency reuse one scheme, where the whole bandwidth is used in each cell. In this paper, we propose a full dynamic intercell interference coordination scheme with no bandwidth partitioning for downlink Long Term Evolution networks. We use a reinforcement learning approach. The proposed scheme is a joint resource allocation and power allocation scheme and its purpose is to minimize intercell interference in Long Term Evolution networks. Performances of proposed scheme shows quality of service improvement in terms of SINR, packet loss and delay compared to other algorithms. © 2019 by the author.},

abstract={During the past few years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become widely used due to their large amount of applications. The use of WSNs is an imperative necessity for future revolutionary areas like ecological fields or smart cities in which more than hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes are deployed. In those large scale WSNs, hierarchical approaches improve the performance of the network and increase its lifetime. Hierarchy inside a WSN consists in cutting the whole network into sub-networks called clusters which are led by Cluster Heads. In spite of the advantages of the clustering on large WSNs, it remains a non-deterministic polynomial hard problem which is not solved efficiently by traditional clustering. The recent researches conducted on Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, and WSNs bring out the optimized clustering algorithms for WSNs. These kinds of clustering are based on environmental behaviors and outperform the traditional clustering algorithms. However, due to the diversity of WSN applications, the choice of an appropriate paradigm for a clustering solution remains a problem. In this paper, we conduct a wide review of proposed optimized clustering solutions nowadays. In order to evaluate them, we consider 10 parameters. Based on these parameters, we propose a comparison of these optimized clustering approaches. From the analysis, we observe that centralized clustering solutions based on the Swarm Intelligence paradigm are more adapted for applications with low energy consumption, high data delivery rate, or high scalability than algorithms based on the other presented paradigms. Moreover, when an application does not need a large amount of nodes within a field, the Fuzzy Logic based solution are suitable. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The IoT influence is growing rapidly and it is expected that in the near future the number of connected IoT nodes will be in billions. Mobility of nodes is a key aspect in the IoT and network simulations are used to evaluate the performance of IoT networks with mobility. The increasing number of nodes will affect simulation environments by increasing the number of nodes per simulation and these simulations will require a long time to complete. So, techniques to reduce the time consumed in simulations are important. A possible technique is the use of contact traces when simulating mobility. A contact trace differs from a real trace or a synthetic mobility model in that, it deals with contact information instead of coordinate information. In this work, we have compared the performance of contact traces against coordinate based real traces and mobility models. For our evaluations we use the OPS framework of models built in OMNeT++. In the contact based approach, the use of real traces or mobility models will be removed and instead, nodes will use contact traces to obtain information about connections with other nodes. But this approach requires an additional step, before a simulation, to generate the contact traces. Even with this step, we show that using contact traces is advantageous in terms of simulation durations. When the scale of simulations increase (i.e., in terms of number of nodes, simulated times, etc.), the results presented show that the advantage increases considerably. © 2019, EasyChair.

abstract={Opportunistic networks enables the devices to communicate as and when the opportunity rises. This property of OppNets has been explored in routing approaches in a similar operating manner as the traditional infrastructure networks. Specifically, context-aware routing approaches have been the major focus of OppNets in the recent literature. However, the potential of OppNets also extends to data dissemination in destination-less networks. Forwarding approaches in such a network need context such that the data dissemination is favored without the necessity to reach a particular set of users or a particular destination. Hence, the context-awareness need to be defined differently for destination-less OppNets as compared to OppNets in destination-oriented scenarios. In this paper, we propose a mobility aided context-aware mechanism for data dissemination in destination-less OppNets based on mobility based local information available at individual nodes. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high delivery ratios as epidemic routing while reducing the overhead by 70% as compared to epidemic routing. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this chapter, we focus on how to simulate Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) in OMNeT++. After defining what OppNets are and how they are different from other networking concepts, we detail, one by one, the necessary models for simulating them, such as mobility, network traffic, user behavior, and communication models focusing on the framework that we have built to simulate OppNets called Opportunistic Protocol Simulator (OPS). Furthermore, we pay special attention to various data dissemination models and the metrics required to evaluate OppNets. Towards the end, we provide a tutorial on setting up and using OPS with two use cases that include the different parameters configured to simulate these use cases and an analysis of the results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Multipath transport protocols are aimed at increasing the throughput of data flows as well as maintaining fairness between users, which are both crucial factors to maximize user satisfaction. In this paper, a mixed (non)linear programming (MINLP) solution is developed which provides an optimum solution to allocate link capacities in a network to a number of given traffic demands considering both the maximization of link utilization as well as fairness between transport layer data flows or subflows. The solutions of the MINLP formulation are evaluated w. r. t. their throughput and fairness using well-known metrics from the literature. It is shown that network flow fairness based capacity allocation achieves better fairness results than the bottleneck-based methods in most cases while yielding the same capacity allocation performance. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Unlike other fields of computing and communications, low-power wireless networking is plagued by one major issue: the absence of a well-defined, agreed-upon yardstick to compare the performance of systems, namely, a benchmark.

This paper describes a recent initiative to remedy this situation, seeking to enlarge the participation from the community. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation is one of the most powerful tools we have for evaluating the performance of opportunistic networks (OppNets). In this paper, we focus on available tools and models, compare their performance and precision and experimentally show the scalability of different simulators. We also perform a gap analysis of state-of-the-art OppNet simulations and sketch out possible further development and lines of research. This paper is targeted at students starting work and research in this area while also serving as a valuable source of information for experienced researchers. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Use of mobility models to model user movement in mobile networks is a key aspect when developing and evaluating networking protocols in simulators. A trace obtained from an actual user movement is considered as being more realistic than using synthetic mobility models in simulators. Though realistic, usually, these traces lack information about the actual wireless contact durations between users. Most simulators use Unit Disk Graph (UDG) model to determine contact durations. However, due to the nature of radio propagations, a simplistic connectivity model (with UDG) may result in simulating unrealistic connectivity patterns. In this work, we have used an Android Smartphone application to collect GPS traces of moving users and their corresponding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) contact times to compare the viability of using UDG to determine contact durations. The results show that trace based model with UDG based wireless connectivity is an effective method to determine contact durations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The use of opportunistic communications to disseminate common interest messages in an urban scenario have various applications, like sharing traffic status, advertising shop offers, spread alarms, and so on. In this paper, we evaluate the combined use of fixed and mobile nodes to establish an optimal urban opportunistic network aimed at the distribution of general interest data. Our results not only contradict current assumptions about the combination of fixed and mobile nodes, but also provide interesting general-purpose observations about the dynamics of opportunistic networks. First of all, we found that mobility is not the hindering and challenging property of these networks, but probably their main enabler. Moreover, we determined that if we want to increase the performance of opportunistic networks by increasing the node density, we should increase the number of mobile and not the fixed nodes since adding fixed nodes only increases the overhead. Finally, our evaluation approach goes beyond the state of the art and is based on using two different simulators, the ONE and OMNeT++, and two different mobility traces from cities with different structure. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={All over the world, road congestion is among the most prevalent transport challenges usually in urban environments which not only increases fuel consumption and emission of harmful gases, but also causes stress for the drivers. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) enables a better use of the infrastructure by connecting vehicles to other vehicles as well as infrastructure and thus delivers a faster communication opportunity to ensure safe and secure driving. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is one of the latest information and communication technologies which offers ubiquitous connectivity among several smart devices. The use of mobile (cellular) M2M communications has emerged due to the wide range, high reliability, increased data rates, decreased costs as well as easy and short-term deployment opportunities. Since the radio spectrum is a scarce resource, M2M traffic can potentially degrade the performance of mobile networks due to the large number of devices sending small-sized data. This paper presents an efficient data multiplexing scheme by using Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-Advanced) Relay Nodes, which aggregates M2M traffic to maximize radio resource utilization. Extensive system-level simulations are performed using an LTE-Advanced-based model developed in the RIVERBED modeler to evaluate the performance of the proposed data multiplexing scheme. Simulation results show that approximately 40 % more smart M2M devices used in ITS and logistics are served per LTE-Advanced cell under the present system settings. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={In this demo, we introduce a new sensor node for underground monitoring called the MoleNet. The MoleNet is designed especially for wireless underground operation. The development of the platform is part of a revitalization project in Cameroon. Due to certain constraints, the project terrain requires a complete underground deployment of the soil monitoring system. The underground channel is quite different from the terrestrial channel and hence presents new challenges for the researchers. The MoleNet strives to overcome these challenges. It focuses on an increased operational life and enhanced communication range. The current revision of MoleNet achieves almost 5 years of battery life, an underground to underground (UG2UG) communication range of 7.5m and an underground to aboveground (UG2AG) communication range of 80m. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We present MOTEL: a robotic-assisted flexible mobile wireless sensor network testbed. MOTEL enables the deployment and testing of wireless sensor nodes, piggybacked on mobile robots to enable their controlled mobility. MOTEL exhibits several important novel properties, compared to existing mobility enabled WSN testbeds. First, the mobility of the robots is fully controlled, flexible and repeatable. Furthermore, the number of robots is unlimited and the used robotic platform can be exchanged easily. Second, the sensor nodes use our flexible software architecture called FLEXOR to enable standard testbed tools like software exchange, sensor node inspection and data logging on the wirelessly connected nodes. Last, but not least, MOTEL can be deployed in any indoor environment in several hours, which makes it well suited for various experimentation and testing purposes. In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of both MOTEL components: the mobile robot control MuRobA and the WSN software architecture FLEXOR.We also present the tools and the usage of MOTEL as a whole, as well as an experimental scenario to demonstrate the usage of MOTEL. © 2015 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={The number of computing devices of the IoT are expected to grow exponentially. To address the communication needs of the IoT, research is being done to develop new networking architectures and to extend existing architectures. An area that lacks attention in these efforts is the emphasis on utilisation of omnipresent local data. There are a number of issues (e.g., underutilisation of local resources and dependence on cloud based data) that need to be addressed to exploit the benefits of utilising local data. We present a novel data dissemination model, called the Organic Data Dissemination (ODD) model to utilise the omni-present data around us, where devices deployed with the ODD model are able to operate even without the existence of networking infrastructure. The realisation of the ODD model requires innovations in many different area including the areas of opportunistic communications, naming of information, direct peer-to-peer communications and reinforcement learning. This paper focuses on highlighting the usage of the ODD model in real application scenarios and the details of the architectural components. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2015.},

abstract={In the health care domain up to the 70% of the revenues can be due to the staff workload costs, which are rerouted to health care insurances and patients. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to determine how much of these costs are really due to the patient care. Some hospitals adopted Real Time Location System solutions in order to optimize staff workload. However, even though these systems are able to localize the staff inside the hospital facilities, they are not intended for computing the time spent by a caregiver while taking care of a patient. Moreover, the localization accuracy of these systems is too low to address this problem. In this paper we present Proxy-Care, a novel patient care tracking system able to compute automatically the time spent by the caregivers, differentiated by doctors, nurses and caretakers, while they are taking care of individual patients. Our results show that with Proxy-Care we are able to localize the caregiver at room level with an accuracy of 98.5%, and to recognize the proximity between the caregiver and the patient, in rooms with two or more patients, with an accuracy of 92%. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The Zigbee low-power communication standard has established itself as one of the most important wireless standards, enabling thousands of industrial and environmental monitoring applications. At the same time, Bluetooth and newly also Bluetooth Low Energy has captured the gadget and smartphone markets and currently enables various health and personal applications. The border between these two markets becomes thinner and applications would profit significantly from interconnecting these two standards and sharing the information obtained. We will demonstrate our custom designed device BLupZi, which interconnects the worlds of Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee. It can be configured to stream all data from one of the networks to the other or to filter particular packet types or source IDs. We will present two examples with two different types of Zigbee sensor nodes and a smartphone. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Diffusion of smart mobile devices offers unprecedented opportunities to monitor travel behaviour, by means of the GPS devices they are equipped with: using a suitable application, potentially every smartphone owner can produce huge, inexpensive quantities of data suitable to profile her mobility patterns. We take advantage of this opportunity within the e-mobiliTI project, which aims at analysing the main psychological and behavioural barriers affecting the transition to new mobility solutions. The project sets up a "living lab" made up of around twenty families and gives them the opportunity to test electric cars and bikes, public transport season tickets and car and bike sharing. Beside traditional social research tools (questionnaires, interviews, focus groups), to analyse their mobility behaviour we use a specifically developed smartphone application. In this paper we present the results of the first phase of our field trial and discuss the major challenges faced so far in the automatic gathering of mobility data: high battery consumption, limited performances of the GPS smartphone devices, problems in the Internet connectivity, limited reliability of the information the application asks to the users and risk that the users quit using the application, due to the lack of immediate compensation for the nuisance of being always monitored and for the daily effort of actively using the application.},

abstract={The diffusion of electric vehicles is currently the most promising opportunity to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel in the mobility sector. However, the adoption of the electric vehicles seems to be still hindered by psychological and behavioural barriers. Thus, in order to understand and to foster the transition towards more sustainable mobility styles, it becomes essential to adopt an inter-disciplinary approach. In this framework, the e-mobiliTI project was launched in late 2012 in Southern Switzerland. It aims at understanding the potential for transition in the mobility system at the local level, with a special focus on electric mobility. The project builds upon a small living lab made up of around twenty families, who will be monitored in all their trips through smart mobile devices, in order to get quantitative data, and through focus groups, in order to get qualitative data and perceptions. Here we discuss the major challenge in the initial stage of the e-mobiliTI project, that is the gathering of reliable and high-quality data on users' behaviour. We describe the automatic tracking system, and the data processing and the qualitative assessment approach and comment on the overall performances of the living lab experiment. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={Mobility is a major innovation of the last decades that came with wireless networking. Architectural mobility solutions can range from single-node mobility architectural aspects, up to solutions for the whole (mobile) network. In mesh networks, end-user mobility requires supporting seamless vertical (among different type of networks) and horizontal (among networks of the same type) handovers between different domains (interdomain handoff or macro-mobility) or inside the same domain (intradomain handoff or micromobility). In sensor networks, mobility is more related to link state evaluation, and support of dynamic procedures for reconnecting the network. In this chapter we focus on the architectural solutions for supporting mobility in wireless mesh networks and sensor networks, their issues, their characteristics, and related performance.© 2013 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

abstract={In this paper, we study the impact of node density on data dissemination time and achieved data quality in a distributed people-centric system. Our results are obtained through an extensive simulation campaign employing Random Way Point and Random Direction mobility and realistic node densities of real environments. Our simulation results show that, the impact of node density does not significantly affect the data dissemination time after a certain threshold of node density, without compromising the achieved data quality. This result is evident for both mobility models. Our study provides an insight to the parameters we need to consider while evaluating the success of any distributed people-centric system. © 2013 ACM.},

Mainly, they are able to provide communication without the use of an infrastructure and to guarantee full data and user anonymity. However, their implementation is not trivial and requires innovation in many different fields, such as opportunistic communications, big data management and security.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) penetrated the market mainly as solutions for specific application scenarios. However, this strong specialization limits WSNs reuse both in terms of development as well as in terms of technical results: Every new application scenario requires a new design, development and validation, as well as management skills. This is frustrating for any WSNs user, developer or manager. To reverse this tendency and thus improve the quality of experience and user-friendliness in WSNs, we designed FLEXOR, a sustainable software architecture optimized to support the implementation, rapid prototyping, evaluation, and testing of wireless sensor network applications, that is platform independent and user-friendly. FLEXOR is designed to accommodate many different applications and services for wireless sensor networks and foster code re-usability and cross-platform component re-usability. FLEXOR offers high modularity, well defined interfaces, remote node management functionality as well as run-time module exchange. Finally, the introduction of a unifying way for WSNs development opens to a higher homogeneity and thus to more easy comparison among different solutions.

abstract={This position paper explores the problem of realistically evaluating wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, algorithms and protocols. It surveys the currently available techniques, such as simulators, testbeds and real world deployments and compares their properties and challenges. While we underline the significance of simulation tools, we also observe that the state of the art simulation models at all levels (from physical to application) still lack realistic behavior. To demonstrate this gap we performed a broad study of simulation models and real world behavior of wireless links and compared those in various settings, including outdoor environments and battery-based deployments. Based on the provided survey and wireless link case study, we outline a strategy of how to enable realistic, efficient, low-cost and repeatable WSN evaluation scenarios. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Opportunistic networks consist of mobile devices, carried by people in their everyday lives. They organize autonomously to exchange data with direct neighbors without the use of any infrastructural services. Since the devices are carried by humans, one of the main challenges to consider in opportunistic networks is the human mobility behavior. However, little work exists on how the social behavior of people drives their mobility behavior and how this context information can be systematically leveraged for opportunistic networking applications. This paper tackles this problem by providing both experimental and theoretical analysis of human mobility context information. We present a novel real world experiment with sensor nodes carried by people to demonstrate and study the effect of context on people mobility. Furthermore, we define a novel metric of social distance to put this new evidence on solid mathematical foundation. Thus, our work puts a basis to systematically leveraging context information for opportunistic networking applications and services. Additionally, our experimental data traces enable testing and evaluation of such novel services in a real world scenario. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={A growing class of wireless sensor network (WSN) applications require the use of sensed data inside the network at multiple, possibly mobile base stations. Standard WSN routing techniques that move data from multiple sources to a single, fixed base station are not applicable, motivating new solutions that efficiently achieve multicast and handle mobility. This paper explores in depth the requirements of this set of application scenarios and proposes Froms, a machine learning-based multicast routing paradigm. Its primary benefits are flexibility to optimize routing over a variety of properties such as route length, battery levels, ease of recovery after node failures, and native support for sink mobility. We provide theoretical, simulation and experimentation results supporting these claims, showing the benefits of Froms in terms of low routing overhead, extended network lifetime, and other key metrics for the WSN environment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Node lifetime is a key performance metric in wireless sensor network (WSN) research. Simplistic assumptions and nave lifetime estimation techniques invariably prove to be extremely unreliable in practice, to the point that premature battery depletion notoriously affects real-world deployments. In this paper we adopt an experimental approach and employ various types of real-world batteries to determine the actual lifespan of a sensor node under common operating conditions. We present a rich set of results from an extensive experimental campaign based on the widely used TelosB platform running TinyOS. We have measured the actual node lifetime using various brands of commercial batteries as a function of different combinations of application parameters. Some of our observations match previously published results that are often neglected, while others underscore less known properties of low-power radios. © 2011 IEEE.},

We present a solution for radio-based people counting that employs low-end motes to detect the signature of shadowing events left by humans on the RF signal as they interrupt the line-of-sight path between a radio transmitter and a receiver. Our solution can be implemented with devices with a reduced form factor, requires little computing power, and provides a satisfactory performance at a low energy cost. We illustrate our implementation on TelosB nodes and present an extensive set of results from a real-world deployment. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of distributed autonomous devices that can sense or monitor physical or environmental conditions cooperatively. WSNs face many challenges, mainly caused by communication failures, storage and computational constraints and limited power supply. Paradigms of computational intelligence (CI) have been successfully used in recent years to address various challenges such as data aggregation and fusion, energy aware routing, task scheduling, security, optimal deployment and localization. CI provides adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness against topology changes, communication failures and scenario changes. However, WSN developers are usually not or not completely aware of the potential CI algorithms offer. On the other side, CI researchers are not familiar with all real problems and subtle requirements of WSNs. This mismatch makes collaboration and development difficult. This paper intends to close this gap and foster collaboration by offering a detailed introduction to WSNs and their properties. An extensive survey of CI applications to various problems in WSNs from various research areas and publication venues is presented in the paper. Besides, a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of CI algorithms over traditional WSN solutions is offered. In addition, a general evaluation of CI algorithms is presented, which will serve as a guide for using CI algorithms for WSNs. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Node clustering and data aggregation are popular techniques to reduce energy consumption in large WSNs and a large body of literature has emerged describing various clustering protocols. Unfortunately, for practitioners wishing to exploit clustering in deployments, there is little help when trying to identify a protocol that meets their needs. This paper takes a step back from specific protocols to consider the fundamental question: what is the optimal cluster size in terms of the resulting communication generated to collect data. Our experimental analysis considers a wide range of parameters that characterize the WSN, and shows that in the most common cases, clusters in which all nodes can communicate in one hop to the cluster head are optimal. © 2010 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Teaching wireless sensor networks (WSNs) at the undergraduate level is both challenging and rewarding. WSNs include low-level programming and debugging, power-aware operations, novel communication paradigms and interdisciplinary applications in real world environments. These characteristics enable the students to learn how to cope with complete systems, starting with hardware design and low-level programming throughout applications and data processing. They learn to recognize complex software-hardware cross-dependencies and to manage them successfully. In this paper we share our experience from a new course on " Introduction to Wireless Sensor Networks" at the undergraduate level. The most important characteristic of the course is its hands-on approach. We believe this is crucial for fully understanding the complex nature of WSNs and their interdependencies with the environment in which they operate. The students were able to build a solid set of skills and expertise in WSNs by designing and implementing their own small-size real-world WSN deployment. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Clustering and aggregation inherently increase wireless sensor network (WSN) lifetime by collecting information within a cluster at a cluster head, reducing the amount of data through computation, then forwarding it. Traditional approaches, however, both spend extensive communication energy to identify the cluster heads and are inflexible to network dynamics such as those arising from sink mobility, node failure, or dwindling battery reserves. This paper presents CLIQUE, an approach for data clustering that saves cluster head selection energy by using machine learning to enable nodes to independently decide whether or not to act as a cluster head on a per-packet basis. We refer to this lack of actual cluster head assignment as being role-free, and demonstrate through simulations that, when combined with learning dynamic network properties such as battery reserves, up to 25% less energy is consumed in comparison to a traditional, random cluster head selection approach. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient multi-hop data dissemination is a crucial building block to enable mature wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. Exploiting machine learning for these routing problems has received increasing attention in recent years due to its flexibility and localized mechanisms. However, with such an approach the resulting protocols often have additional memory and processing time requirements. Nevertheless, these requirements are within the reach of today's WSN hardware, however few substantial tests have been performed to clearly demonstrate this. This paper evaluates and discusses the results and experiences gained from implementing our reinforcement learning based multicast routing protocol (FROMS) in a testbed of ScatterWeb nodes. A comparison of our results is made to a well-known WSN routing scheme, namely a multicast variation of Directed Diffusion. Our evaluation includes several minor, but practical modifications to both protocols such as transmission backoffs and the use of acknowledgments. This paper offers three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can be efficiently implemented on resource restricted devices and that they perform very well in multiple network scenarios. Second, we confirm the validity of simulation results obtained in a previous evaluation of FROMS, and at the same time gather delivery rates under realistic settings. Finally, we offer some general observations on properties and pitfalls of WSN implementations along with potential solutions. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This work is a survey on the usage of machine learning techniques in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Its focus lies on approaches for data routing. The goal of the work is two-fold: first, to classify and evaluate the most important existing and on-going research in the area and, second, to provide a guide for researchers wanting to apply machine learning techniques. For this, it also gives short description of the most appropriate algorithms and suggests for which scenarios they can be best used. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In the domain of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), information routing is both a fundamental and challenging problem. In this work, we describe how information local to each node can be shared without overhead as feedback to neighboring nodes, enabling efficient routing to multiple sinks. Such a situation arises in WSNs with multiple, possibly mobile users collecting data from a monitored area. We formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning task, and apply Q-Routing techniques to derive a solution. Evaluation of the resulting FROMS protocol demonstrates its ability to significantly decrease the network overhead over existing approaches. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficiently moving sensor data from its collection to use points is both the fundamental and the most difficult challenge in wireless sensor networks, as any data movement incurs cost. In this work, we focus on routing data to multiple, possibly mobile sinks. To deal with the dynamics of the environment arising from mobility and failures, we choose a reinforcement learning approach where neighboring nodes exchange small amounts of information allowing them to learn the next, best hop to reach all sinks. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates that our technique results in low cost routes with low overhead for the learning process. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Interest in extracting and exploiting information from wireless sensor networks has been increasing for several years. Most scenarios focus on collecting and evaluating large amounts of data at a single sink, and many protocols and algorithms have been designed to accomplish this efficiently. However, not all applications require all data, nor do they have a single collection point Instead, multiple moving base stations collect and exploit information, concentrating on data gathered in their immediate vicinity and requiring less precise knowledge about the data collected far away. While such a scenario can be supported by traditional approaches that present perfect information, they actually require less data, therefore providing a clear opportunity for increasing network lifetime without sacrificing the data quality requirements of the application. This idea of non uniform quality of service is the focus of this paper, along with two preliminary protocols demonstrating its potential and motivating future work. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={A new modality for sensor networks emerges when considering multiple, distributed base stations that collect data from sensors. This scenario reverses the typical multiple-source, single-sink scenario, and requires new techniques to efficiently send data from single-sources to multiple-sinks. While an offline approach with full topology information can build the optimal data forwarding tree, the challenge we address here is to optimize data forwarding with only information exchanged among one-hop neighbors. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of an iterative learning technique that explores alternative routes by locally sharing feedback regarding route fitness. This paper presents our approach as well as an evaluation showing that the learned paths lead to increases in network lifetime of up to 50% over an approach without learning. © 2007 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

abstract={We show how to apply learning methods to two robotics problems, namely the optimization of the on-board controller of an omnidirectional robot, and the derivation of a model of the physical driving behavior for use in a simulator. We show that optimal control parameters for several PID controllers can be learned adaptively by driving an omni directional robot on a field while evaluating its behavior, using an reinforcement learning algorithm. After training, the robots can follow the desired path faster and more elegantly than with manually adjusted parameters. Secondly, we show how to learn the physical behavior of a robot. Our system learns to predict the position of the robots in the future according to their reactions to sent commands. We use the learned behavior in the simulation of the robots instead of adjusting the physical simulation model whenever the mechanics of the robot changes. The updated simulation reflects then the modified physics of the robot. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={We have developed an automatic calibration method for a global camera system. Firstly, we show how to define automatically the color maps we use for tracking the robots' markers. The color maps store the parameters of each important color in a grid superimposed virtually on the field. Secondly, we show that the geometric distortion of the camera can be computed automatically by finding white lines on the field. The necessary geometric correction is adapted iteratively until the white lines in the image fit the white lines in the model. Our method simplifies and speeds up significantly the whole setup process at RoboCup competitions. We will use these techniques in RoboCup 2004. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={This paper describes a method to reduce the effects of the system immanent control delay for the RoboCup small size league. It explains how we solved the task by predicting the movement of our robots using a neural network. Recently sensed robot positions and orientations as well as the most recent motion commands sent to the robot are used as input for the prediction. The neural network is trained with data recorded from real robots. We have successfully field-tested the system at several RoboCup competitions with our FU-Fighters team. The predictions improve speed and accuracy of play. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},
