abstract={A new SAR ADC architecture is proposed. The described circuit uses an additional low-resolution capacitive-DAC instead of MSB-capacitors switching in the conventional binary weighted DAC. The use of an additional DAC decreases the MSB capacitors size, therefore improves the energy efficiency and allows to achieve faster operation speed. The circuit operates using a 4-input comparator. The sampling capacitance is 98.4% reduced compared to conventional SAR ADC. The DAC switching energy saving of the proposed circuit is 97.2% compared to a conventional one. The 20 MS/s 10 bit SAR ADC based on the proposed architecture was simulated on transistor level. The power consumption and the Walden FOM are 70.88 uW and 3.71 fJ/conv.-step respectively. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={While linear equalization schemes like zero forcing or minimum mean-square error achieve a near optimal uplink signal estimation performance in large-scale multi-user multiple-input multiple-output systems, the corresponding algorithms lean on centralized processing. To avoid disproportionate interconnect data rates due to the centralized signal estimation, performing a decentralized equalization can mitigate these effects. In this paper, we present a decentralized signal estimation architecture, which combines the ideas of existing decentralized architectures to (i) reduce the overall latency of the signal estimation and (ii) maintain a high data detection performance. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a block extended coordinate descent algorithm is introduced for MMSE based soft-output massive MIMO signal detection, which exploits the simple inversion of small sub-Gram matrices to allow a low-complexity implementation. We show that the resulting two-coordinates descent approach has a computational complexity comparable to the original coordinate descent signal detector, whereas the latency bottleneck can be relaxed and further the data detection performance can be improved as the simulation results show. Also we show the possibility to approximate the Gram matrix with fewer multiplications while maintaining a near-optimal detection performance. © 2019 IEEE},

abstract={This paper analyzes the combined effects of process variation and aging, namely HCI and BTI, on the performance of flip-flops. To enable this evaluation, a stochastic reliability simulation flow which combines Monte Carlo simulations with degradation is presented. It makes use of a charged-based degradation-aware transistor model incorporating both process variation and aging effects into a normal SPICE simulation without the need of an additional aging simulator. The simulation flow enables the continuous evaluation of the changing stress conditions while keeping the simulation effort at a reasonable level. The analysis is performed on two different flip-flop architectures, a master slave flip-flop and a pulsed flip-flop, to determine the shift of timing performance distributions over time as well as the dependence on temperature. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In industrial environments, automation companies seek for wireless solutions for their real-time demanding production lines. Complicated wiring, feasibility problems in connecting moving parts and high cost limit the operation of wired communication systems like EtherCAT or POWERLINK. The specified ultra reliable low latency communication channel in 5G networks is planned to support robust wireless connection for guaranteed latency of 1 ms. But up to now, it is not yet clear, whether 5G will provide frequently used industry communication interfaces or not. Additionally, to the authors knowledge, there has no 5G transceiver been built up yet, which is proven to fulfill all industry specific demands. For this reason, other standalone solutions for this tasks are developed. To meet the industry requirements, all hardware must be designed for low latency and low hardware complexity at maximum robustness. This paper addresses channel estimation and equalization hardware architectures for use in such systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

With SORN arithmetic operations can be carried out using simple lookup tables which results in a very fast and low-complex way of computing. The new arithmetic is applied to an exhaustive search algorithm for maximum likelihood symbol detection in a MIMO transmission environment. The algorithm is implemented in hardware and executed on a Zynq-7000 FPGA. It is shown that the amount of possible solutions for the symbol detection can be reduced by up to 80% using the fast SORN architecture as a preprocessing stage for classic solvers. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, the wireless commuication system development driven by the ongoing Industry 4.0 (I40) and Indusrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) has been growing enormously. In industrial automation and manufacturing, closed-loop control applications are commonly used, which require completely new solutions to achieve latencies of 1ms with extremely high reliability and stringent requirements on message timing and repetitive packet losses. A hardware-based solution for baseband signal processing aiming at such challenges is introduced in this work. With a novel design and integration of the baseband signal processing blocks, the key highlights of this solution are a) multi-user support, b) simple and flexible integration in the industrial application, c) low hardware overhead, and d) high data throughput with low latency. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine-type communications is quite often of very low data rate and of sporadic nature. In a multi-user wireless sensor network, this sporadic transmission activity can favourably be exploited to facilitate a joint activity and data detection on the physical layer as it has been shown in previous works. This abolishes the need for shared channel access signaling on higher network layers and increases bandwidth efficiency. However, each data source transmits over a user-specific channel which makes channel estimation mandatory for phase-coherent reception and channel equalisation. Since a totally blind estimation of channels, transmit activities and user data simultaneously is practically infeasible, we propose a joint activity and channel estimation scheme based on pilots and matching pursuit algorithms. We show that Zadoff-Chu sequences lead to a better user separation and estimation performance than random Gaussian codes. And since we do not make any assumptions about the user's data payload, our results are generally valid for any frame structure. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={In this paper an on-line monitoring method for the threshold voltage of MOSFETs is presented. A state space model of the device under test is pre-fitted and used within a particle filter algorithm. The method is capable of extracting the threshold voltage in arbitrary mission or stress conditions. Thus, for reliability assessments the stress does not have to be relieved in order to measure a shift of the threshold voltage. Moreover, the monitoring is able to cancel out certain environmental influences such as temperature and supply voltage fluctuations which is a major improvement for any reliability assessment. The method is evaluated with TCAD (FDSOI Transistor) and SPICE (CMOS Transistor) simulations. © 2018 IEEE.},

Automated simulation of IC testbenches is possible. Additionally, arbitrary data from other sources (TCAD, measurements) can be used to create models. Evaluation of statistical performance variation due to process variation is also incorporated to allow the creation of stochastic behavioral models. RSMs can be exported as MATLAB functions as well as Verilog-A functions with automatic inclusion into an existing behavioral model. The tool is easily extensible due to its implementation.

abstract={Process variations have a large influence on the behavior of integrated circuits. Although individual process parameters are mostly considered as normal or uniformly distributed, the resulting performance distribution of a circuit cannot always be assumed to be normally distributed due to non-linearities. In this paper an approach is presented which uses Kernel Density Estimation to calculate the non-normal performance distributions. The resulting probability density function is approximated by curve fitting to reduce complexity. A Look-Up table based stochastic model is build by analyzing the performance distribution at different operating conditions. In order to draw random samples from the distribution, slice sampling is applied. The application of the modeling method is evaluated at the example of an amplifier. © 2018 IEEE.},

Kernel Density Estimation is applied to find the pdf describing the performance distribution. To reduce the complexity, the resulting pdf is approximated using a Gaussian model fit. In order to build the LUT-based model, the performance distributions are evaluated at different operating conditions. Slice sampling is applied to draw random samples from the probability density. The approach is evaluated at the example of an Common Source amplifier, whose gain is strongly non-normally distributed. The evaluation shows good results at different operating conditions.

abstract={Resilient systems for future application as the Internet of Things (IoT), aerospace or automotive must satisfy demanding specifications over a 10-years lifespan. Thus, timedependent degradation must be considered in early design stages. To ensure a realistic estimation of degradation impact a whole matrix decomposition algorithm is implemented in a 65nm CMOS technology with different multi threshold voltage standard cells, for a required low-power design. We present an assessment method based on stochastic mission profiles saving at least 10% area and power compared to common methods. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The functionality of modern integrated circuits is affected by numerous non-ideal effects. Especially during the design of analog circuit components, much effort is invested in compensating these effects by various methods. In this work, an alternative approach is presented, which is based on digital calibration techniques and used in a sensor interface circuit. A suitable test signal is interleaved with the sensor signal, whereby the interface is permanently monitored. Static and dynamic errors are detected in this way without interrupting normal sensor activities. Afterwards, these errors are determined and corrected in the digital domain by adaptive filters. Hereby, an on-line error correction is realized, which allows the sensor interface to react to changing ambient conditions and makes it more robust. Furthermore, the design requirements of the analog circuit components can be drastically reduced since not all errors need to be fully compensated in the analog domain. The introduced approach is demonstrated by correcting different gain- and offset-errors in a 65 nm CMOS sensor interface. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The bottleneck of recording multiple parallel channels with resource limited sensor circuits is the achievable data rate. Compressed Sensing (CS) is employed as a means of compressing the recorded data with minimally added hardware overhead. When recording multiple channels using CS one can choose to implement CS for each channel separately or using a multi channel approach to compress all signals at once. This paper presents an empirical study of these two options in terms of achievable reconstruction performance depending on the number of channels and it also presents possible circuit implementations based on successive approximation register digital to analog converter (SAR ADC). The multi channel approach requires a certain minimum number of input channels to be feasible. Exceeding this minimum will increase the performance beyond the limits of the single channel implementation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Massive MIMO systems have become more popular in wireless communications due to their improved spectral efficiency compared to existing small-scale MIMO systems. However, current estimation methodes take too long for larger numbers of antennas. In this paper, a near-optimal iterative linear signal detection for massive MIMO is introduced exploiting the random projection method to approximate the channel matrix in a significantly lower dimensional space. This is then used as a preconditioner in the conjugate gradient least squares algorithm to enhance the convergence rate. For evaluation, different scenarios of spatial correlation in a massive MIMO system are considered. In contrast to other low-complexity signal detectors, our approach achieves excellent results in terms of robustness and determined latency. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we introduce an inpainting design methodology based on masked data acquisition which allows a beneficial shifting of computational load between the data acquisition system and data processing to enhance existing approaches or to find solutions to resource constrained systems. The proposed methodology is a powerful tool to systems, which are limited to, e.g., area or/and energy consumption, but have to handle high data volumes or require long sensing times. Standard methods like JPEG or compressed sensing provide solutions accompanied by a high computational load corresponding to an area and energy consuming large ciruit complexity or insufficient recovered data quality. However, the results in this work based on the proposed inpainting-related guidelines, e.g., for biomedical signal processing or satellite applications outperform State-of-the-Art techniques and prior works without additional computational load. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Numerous applications require the use of robust and reliable integrated circuits. In order to develop such circuits, a wide variety of influences need to be considered and also compensated if necessary. For a complete consideration of all reliability issues, the circuit has to be investigated on different levels of abstraction and together with the complete overlying system. These requirements are addressed in this work by using cross-layer design methods for the development of a generic sensor interface as an example for a complex integrated circuit. During the development, a reliability-aware design is used and major physical effects are taken into account, which alter the overall behavior of the system. Furthermore, modeling techniques are applied to port influences and circuit components from one level of abstraction to another. Possible countermeasures and compensation techniques for a reliable circuit design are also analyzed on transistor and system level. The result is a sensor interface circuit, which can be used to investigate all effects of interest and suitable countermeasures on different abstraction levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bivariate function approximation has proven its feasibility in terms of hardware-efficient arithmetic signal processing. However, its impact on high performance QR decomposition (QRD) has only been roughly studied so far. In this paper, a novel hardware architecture for Givens-Rotation-based QRD is proposed targeting hardware efficient signal processing. To this end, an ingenious triangular systolic array structure is considered. Complex-valued matrices are efficiently processed by means of a sophisticated bivariate numeric function approximation methodology. In order to get a comprehensive insight in the performance, exhaustive evaluation is carried out with a modern multi-antenna wireless communication system. In detail, the proposed QRD hardware architecture is used in a suitable channel pre-coding setup. For a meaningful proof-of-concept, our work is evaluated on several levels of the computing stack. In addition, our design is implemented and physically synthesized in a state-of-the-art 65-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company technology and compared with other publications. The results indicate our approach to be a powerful solution for hardware-based QRD, especially in terms of energy and area requirements. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we present a novel inpainting algorithm to gain reduced acquisition time and high quality data reconstruction for MRI applications. We analyzed MRI recordings of two synthetically generated and of one real measured data set. On the basis of the proposed mask-based sampling trajectories, patients only have to spend a fraction of the recording time in the MRI. Especially, in the range of high k-space coefficient reduction, the reconstruction quality of our Permuted Cubes Wavelet Thresholding (PCWT) approach can compete with standard data compression-focused methods like JPEG2000 or MPEG-4. In all simulations, the proposed algorithm also outperforms state-of-the-art techniques such as BM3D-MRI with respect to accuracy after data reconstruction. Regarding the quality of the approximated MRI data, we mainly focus on the clear recovery of sharp edges without undesirable artifacts and the identification of tumors within MRI frames. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A Sphere Decoder is a popular tree search algorithm for the solution of integer least squares minimisation problems. It has gained considerable attention for its application to maximum likelihood detection of digitally modulated signals in MIMO communication systems and can almost universally be applied to a plethora of problems with some modifications to the sphere constraint. This creates the need for a baseline digital hardware design of a configurable Sphere Decoder, which can be adjusted for various applications. This paper presents the implementation of a baseline Sphere Decoder with high-level synthesis (HLS) in connection with a data type-agnostic programming methodology, which makes it even more flexible. © EURASIP 2017.},

abstract={This brief presents the new simple schematic for the temperature stable current references based on the well-known β-multiplier circuit. The proposed reference utilizes only four MOS transistors and two lateral PNP transistors, which are usually available in standard CMOS technologies along with one well resistor. The temperature-compensation technique has a low process dependence and needs no trimming. However, resistor trimming can be used to precisely set the output current value. The circuit implementation of the proposed technique was fabricated in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS process to source a 16-μA current. The digital calibration circuit allows setting of the output current in 32 100 nA-steps. The proposed current reference achieves the supply sensitivity of several %/V without the use of the external bandgap voltage reference for the supply regulation. The measured temperature coefficient is 105 ppm/°C over the temperature range from 0 to 110 °C. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Inpainting-based compression and reconstruction methodology can be applied to systems with limited resources to enable continuously monitor neurological activity. In this work, an approach based on sparse representations and K-SVD is augmented to a video processing in order to improve the recovery quality. That was mainly achieved by using another direction of spatial correlation and the extraction of cuboids across frames. The implementation of overlapping frames between the recorded data blocks avoids rising errors at the boundaries during the inpainting-based recovery. Controlling the electrode states per frame plays a key role for high data compression and precise recovery. The proposed 3D inpainting approach can compete with common methods like JPEG, JPEG2000 or MPEG-4 in terms of the degree of compression and reconstruction accuracy, which was applied on real measured local field potentials of a human patient. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a current driver with a novel high voltage (HV) switch schematic for the use as a protective switch for recording circuits during the stimulation sequence in neural measurement system. The current driver can source and sink currents of amplitudes up to ±8.2 mA with a HV tolerance from 30 V up to 120 V. The proposed HV switch also tolerates the voltage difference up to 120 V between its terminals. Between stimulation sequences the driver provides the effective isolation of the stimulation electrode from ground and HV supply voltage. The inter pulse current is no more than 60 pA. The chip was fabricated with AMS HV 0.35 μm CMOS technology. For test purposes the complete stimulation system including the proposed chip and the external C8051F410 controller was build. For the proposed system the mismatch between the sourced and sinked current does not exceed 20 μA. The possibility to stimulate with frequencies up to 1 kHz is proven by measurement along with the electrode-tissue model. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper presents an 8-channel neural stimulator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for biphasic stimulation of the visual cortex, fabricated in a 0.35μm AMS HV process. Each channel is composed of a standard SPI interface, an 8-bit current digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and 120V compliant HV output stage. Thus, it is possible to deliver to the tissue arbitrary current waveforms with amplitudes up to ±8.192mA with 32μA steps. The measured maximum differential nonlinearity (DNL) of the current output does not exceed 1.1 LSB. The on-board current reference provides the output current of 16μA with a very low temperature variation. The maximum anodic and cathodic current mismatch after calibration is 25μA. The measured interpulse leakage current does not exceed 60pA. The ASIC was also tested with the electrode-tissue model, which describes the PEDOT electrodes of 560μm diameter in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The measurement results approve the possibility to stimulate with arbitrary current amplitudes with frequencies up to 1.5kHz. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Process variation and aging effects influence the performances of integrated circuits in modern technology nodes. In this paper, a method is proposed to build a behavioral model to represent the influences of process variation, aging and operational parameters on circuit performances. The variability of performance is represented using distribution functions while Response Surface Models (RSM) are used to describe the dependence of the distribution's moments on operational parameters. Compared to other approaches, less parameters have to be included in the RSM therefore reducing the complexity. This enables a fast Monte-Carlo analysis with aging analysis on a behavioral level. The method is evaluated for a voltage reference circuit and an operational amplifier showing a good representation of the variability and reaching a very good speedup of simulation time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In modern CMOS processes, several non-ideal influences affect the functionality of integrated circuits. In order to analyze and reduce these influences, time intensive circuit simulations are performed at transistor level. Although numerous non-idealities are considered in such simulations, they cannot be analyzed separately since they are inherent parts of the transistor models and cannot be faded out. In this work, a solution to this problem is presented: the use of Verilog-A/MS behavioral models in combination with Response Surface Modeling. Since error sources can easily be switched on and off in these models, their influence on circuit parameters can be examined individually. Moreover, the required simulation time is drastically reduced by using these models. A 65nm CMOS sensor interface is selected to demonstrate the advantages of the introduced approach. The interface is transferred from transistor to behavioral level before both circuit representations are compared in various simulations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a new compact low supply current reference and a simulation-based design procedure to establish the circuit parameters quickly and efficiently. To verify the proposed design procedure, two sub 1 V example circuits for two different reference current values (80 nA and 800 nA) were designed and simulated using 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The circuits are robust against supply voltage variation without the need for external bandgap. A line sensitivity of approximately 1-2%/V over the supply voltage range from sub 1 V is achieved in both cases. The simulated temperature coefficient (TC) values are 93 ppm/C and 197 ppm/° C in the temperature range from 0°C to 120° C for the 800 nA and 80 nA references, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient signal processing takes a key role in application-specific circuit design. For instance, future mobile communication standards, e.g., high-performance industrial mobile communication, require high data rates, low latency and/or high energy-efficiency. Hence, sophisticated algorithms and computing schemes must be explored to satisfy these challenging constraints. In this paper we leverage the paradigm of approximate computing to enable hardware-efficient QR-decomposition for channel pre-coding. For an efficient computation of the Givens-Rotation, bivariate, non-linear numeric functions are taken into account. An effective design method is introduced leading to highly adapted (special-purpose) functions. For evaluation, our work is tested with different configurations in a Tomlinson-Harashima pre-coding downlink environment. In addition, a corresponding HDL implementation is set up and logic and physical CMOS synthesis is performed. The comparison to actual references prove our work to be a powerful approach for future mobile communication systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Consensus-based algorithms are a welcome approach to establish cooperative communication systems. In this work, it has been utilized to present a hardware architecture for distributed data detection in a receiver with several sensor nodes on an easily scalable regular network. Additionally, it is capable to detect the transmitted message even if a single sensor node fails to operate. On top of that, the processing is executed on vector-based application specific instruction set processors as processing cores. This makes it very flexible for reconfiguring the network and reprogramming of the algorithm, though being highly performant. © 2016 IEEE.},

Modern HLS compilers, like Xilinx Vivado HLS, support the evaluation of different architectures by so-called directives. We propose to extend the exploration capabilities through a data type-agnostic programming methodology. Automated by shell scripts, a link between the HLS tool and Mathworks Matlab facilitates the generation of large numbers of test vectors as stimuli to our designs for bit-accurate verification purposes. Additionally, we report on the first implementation of the Approximate Conjugate Gradient Pursuit algorithm, which is exemplarily used to demonstrate the augmented design space exploration capabilities. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper a tool based on the gm/ID-method is presented to provide information on operating point dependent degradation in integrated circuits. The advantage of the presented GMID-Tool is that neither further SPICE nor ageing simulations are required since the fresh and aged small signal parameters of a single transistor are extracted at once. Using the GMID-Tool, the design time of an integrated circuit is reduced significantly. Additionally, the GMID-Tool is process-independent and universally applicable as it takes technology specific data as input. The verification of the GMID-Tool is shown at the example of a Common Source Amplifier and a Miller-OTA. Copyright © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={High-performance QR-decomposition is a key request in many different application areas, e.g., multi-antenna wireless communication systems. In order to achieve high performance, bivariate numeric function approximations have turned out to be a promising approach, though it has only been marginal considered so far. In this paper we leverage existing QR-decomposition hardware architectures by exploiting a novel and high-performance approximation technique for bivariate, trigonometric functions. An enhanced piecewise segmentation scheme is proposed which will reduce the size of the multiplexer-tree. To value our work, the performance is measured and analyzed, on both the algorithmic and the microelectronic level. The results indicate our approach to be a highly efficient hardware solution for QR-decomposition in modern multi-antenna communication systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This work presents fast and efficient patch matching and ordering techniques for a novel inpainting-based compression and reconstruction methodology to continuously monitor neural activity. The mask-based compression is especially relevant for the technical realization of fully implantable neural measurement systems (NMS), because of restrictions regarding area and energy consumption. Novel approaches for decompression significantly reduce the number of computations for the procedure of smooth ordering patches (SOP) by a restricted neighboring search along consistent electrode patterns and by a patch group matching technique. Both combined yields a speed-up of 49.2x compared to an unrestricted patch search. With regard to recovered signal quality and compression of up to 95%, the proposed bridge mask achieves accurate results. The fast inpainting-based processing, including the proposed patch matching and ordering approaches, outperforms compression-focused standard techniques like JPEG and JPEG2000 regarding reconstruction quality of real measured neurological signals at high degrees of data reduction. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Approximate computing of non-trivial numeric functions is a well-known design technique and, therefore, used in several different application areas. Its main idea is the relaxation of conventional correctness constraints to achieve high performance results in terms of throughput and/or energy consumption. In this paper we propose an automated approximate design method for the fast hardware generation of two-dimensional numeric functions. By using multiplier-less gradients in combination with an advanced non-uniform segmentation scheme, high hardware performance is achieved. To qualify our approach, exhaustive evaluation is carried out, considering six different two-variable numeric functions. In a first step, a global complexity estimation is performed with varying design constraints on the algorithmic level. Out of this, most suitable candidates are selected for logic and physical CMOS synthesis. The results are compared to actual references highlighting our work as a powerful approach for the hardware-based calculation of two-variable numeric functions, especially in terms of throughput and energy consumption. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper a tool based on the gm/ID-methodology is presented to provide information on operating point-dependent degradation in integrated circuits caused by NBTI and HCI during early design stages. The advantage of the presented GMID-Tool is that it does not require any further SPICE or aging simulations after the extraction of the fest and aged small signal parameters of a single transistor. Using the GMID-Tool, the design time of an integrated circuit is reduced significantly. In addition, the GMID-Tool is process-independent and universally applicable as it takes technology specific data as input. The verification of the GMID-Tool is shown at the example of a Common-Source Amplifier and a Miller-OTA. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensor networks have gained a lot of attention over the past years and it is expected that the future 5G standard will set communication specifications for the upcoming Internet of Things. Assuming a wireless network where multiple sensors communicate with a single receiving node, this paper will use Zadoff-Chu sequences as a preamble for channel estimation and multi-user activity identification in a sporadic user activity setup. A Neyman-Pearson algorithm detects active transmissions and determines the sampling instances at which the transmitted frame starts and ends. The algorithm was synthesized using High-Level Synthesis and finally implemented on the Nutaq ZeptoSDR. © 2017 VDE VERLAG GMBH.},

abstract={Efficient signal processing is one of the most important challenges for modern digital circuits and systems. For applications that base on complex algorithms, multivariate numeric functions with approximate computational accuracy have become a promising approach. Though, State-of-the Art approximation techniques perform quite well in terms of throughput, the area and energy requirements still need major improvement. In this paper we present a novel design technique for the efficient hardware realization of bivariate numeric functions. A sophisticated gradient encoding scheme is deployed that reduces the size of the multiplexer tree evidently. For evaluation, three different function approximations are generated and compared to actual references. The results highlight our approach to be a powerful extension for high-performance bivariate numeric function approximation. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Automation in industrial production is getting more important, so the need for high data rate, low latency and low power wireless communication is growing. This requires efficient use of bandwidth, in particular for unlicensed bands. In this paper, we present a hardware architecture for analysing the channel utilisation, which is needed in real-time coexistence management systems. Additionally, we compare the solution to a software implementation with respect to performance and real-time capability. The hardware implementation supports real-time channel utilisation sensing, calculating Fast-Fourier-Transform and logarithm. As shown in the results chapter, the hardware solution exceeds software approaches by more than five orders of magnitude in terms of throughput, calculating the Fast-Fourier-Transform and logarithm of a 1024 value wide vector in 17.26 μs at a clock frequency of 60 MHz. The FFT size can be dynamically reconfigured using control signals driven by software, which enables reuse e.g. in multi carrier systems such as GFDM, when coexistence management is not active. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a current driver with a novel high voltage (HV) switch schematic for the use as a protective switch for recording circuits during the stimulation sequence. The current driver can source and sink currents of amplitudes up to ±8.2 mA with HV tolerance from 30 V up to 120 V. The mismatch between the sourced and sinked current does not exceed 20 μA. The inter pulse current is no more than 60 pA. The output HV compliance depends on the HV supply voltage with maximum value of the 120 V. The proposed HV switch also tolerates the voltage difference up to 120V between its terminals. The chip was fabricated with AMS HV 0.35 μm CMOS technology. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to shrinking feature sizes in integrated circuits, additional reliability effects have to be considered which influence the functionality of the system. These effects can either result from the manufacturing process or external influences during the lifetime such as radiation and temperature. Additionally, modern technology nodes are affected by time-dependent degradation i.e. aging. Due to the age-dependent degradation of a circuit, processes on the atomic scale of the semiconductor material lead to charges in the oxide silicon interface of CMOS devices, altering the performance parameters of the device and subsequently the behavior of the circuit. With the continuous downscaling of modern semiconductor technologies, the impact of these atomic scale processes affecting the overall system characteristics becomes more and more critical. Therefore, aging effects need to be assessed during the design phase and actions have to be taken guaranteeing the correct system functionality throughout a system's lifetime. This work presents methods to investigate the influence of age-dependent degradation as well as process-variability on different levels. An operating-point dependent sizing methodology based on the gm/ID-method extended to incorporate aging, which aims at developing aging-resistent circuits is presented. Additionally, the sensitivity of circuit performances in regard to aging can be determined. In order to investigate the reliability of a complex system on behavioral level, a modeling method to represent the performance of system components in dependence of aging and process variability is introduced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper describes a novel design method for direct digital frequency synthesizers with very high accuracy. To this end, we leverage the well-known piecewise, multiplier-less function approximation method by two separate enhancements: A parallel function estimation scheme is applied which increases the approximation accuracy and reduces the segmentation effort. To achieve further performance improvement, gradient encoding is also taken into account. For evaluation, several direct digital frequency synthesizer architectures with varying accuracies are generated and analyzed in terms of complexity and timing. Logic and physical synthesis is performed with selected candidates. The results indicate the proposed function approximation technique as a powerful approach for the design of direct digital frequency synthesizers with spurious free dynamic ranges of 90 dBc and more. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is a greedy algorithm well-known for its applications to Compressed Sensing. For this work it serves as a toy problem of a rapid digital design flow based on high-level synthesis (HLS). HLS facilitates extensive design space exploration in connection with a data type-agnostic programming methodology. Nonetheless, some algorithmic transformations are needed to obtain optimised digital architectures. OMP contains a least squares orthogonalisation step, yet its iterative selection strategy makes rank-1 updating possible. We furthermore propose to compute complex mathematical operations, e.g. The needed reciprocal square root operation, with the help of the logarithmic number system to optimise HLS results. Our results can compete with prior works in terms of latency and resource utilisation. Additionally and to the best of our knowledge, we can report on the first complex-valued digital architecture of OMP, which is able to recover a vector of length 128 with 5 non-zero elements in 17:1 μs. © 2016 IEEE.},

This novel methodology is especially important for the realization of implantable neural measurement systems (NMS), which are subject to strict constraints in terms of area and energy consumption. Such an implant only requires a defined controlling of the electrode activity to compress neural data. To achieve an efficient implementation with high throughput at the data recovery, approximately computation of arithmetic operations and elementary functions is proposed by using the logarithmic number system (LNS). Because of the digital quantization effects of the LNS conversions, an inherent thresholding operation arises. The proposed hardware realization significantly reduces the required iteration of inpainting computations. This inherent zero forcing in conjunction with the algorithmic error correction results in a speed-up in terms of neural signal recovery, which results in a throughput of 32 961 parallel reconstructions per second. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Scaled down analog integrated circuits are prone to degradation. This necessitates an online degradation monitoring and sophisticated analysis of degradation for this circuitry. Voltage reference sources such as beta-multiplier are commonly used circuits to set the operating points for downstream circuitry. Thus, the degradation of these sources are crucial for the overall degradation. In this paper the simulation results of the degradation analysis of a beta-multiplier circuit including the startup circuit, implemented in a 65nm CMOS technology, considering the temperature, are shown. A new approach for online degradation monitoring is introduced, utilizing startup circuit components to ensure minimal area and power overhead. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Inverters are one of the most basic logic blocks and exhibit a strong temperature dependency. Additionally, degradation in CMOS transistors affects the performance of circuits over time and is strongly dependent on temperature during circuit operation. In order to design robust and reliable ring oscillators and time to digital converters, both temperature dependencies have to be considered. This work introduces a circuit design for a robust and resilient inverter and an analysis on its temperature-dependent aging characteristic. The implemented inverter is driven by a common-source amplifier to achieve high robustness against temperature variation and aging effects. Based on this, circuit designs for a ring oscillator and an inverter-based delay line for a time to digital converter has been implemented. The results show that the deviation of the delay for an inverter can be minimized from 13.2% for conventional inverter design to less than 2% for the temperature-and aging-resistant design over a wide temperature range from -40° C to 150° C and a stress time of ten years. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={An analog system's performance can be influenced by many factors such as age-dependent degradation effects which need to be considered during the design process. Transistor level degradation analysis is very time-consuming for large and complex circuits. Behavioral models can be used to speed up the simulation and enable an evaluation on a higher abstraction level. In this paper, a structured method for the development of behavioral models is proposed. By using Response Surface Models to represent a system's key-performances, reliability analysis on system level is possible. A sensitivity analysis is used to identify the relevant parameters and to reduce the overall complexity of the model. The method is demonstrated on an amplifier and a voltage reference. © 2016 Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology.},

abstract={In this paper the first low-latency architecture design and hardware implementation for structure-based inpainting to detect and complete isophotes in brain activity recording is presented. This novel mask-based compression and inpainting-based reconstruction methodology for correlated neural signals is especially important for the realization of implantable neural measurement systems (NMS) due to restrictions in terms of area and energy. The data compression is obtained by on/off controlling of the recording electrodes on implant side. The low-latency and parallel architecture design is based on a synchronous Moore-FSM for 16 bits inputs. It requires only 8 cycles to compute the inpainting-based detection and completion of isophotes. Because of the error-robust inpainting recovery procedure, small accuracy differences between the simulation and measurement results on a Xilinx DS312 Spartan-3E FPGA are negligible. The proposed hardware implementation on logical and physical 350nm CMOS reaches a clock frequency of 78.452 MHz, which leads to a throughput of 653 766 parallel inpainting-based isophote computations per second. © 2016 Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology.},

abstract={In this work we design and implement efficient time synchronization/stamping method for Wireless Sensor Network inside the Vehicle Equipment Bay (VEB) of the ARIANE 5. The sensor nodes in the network do not require real time clock (RTC) hardware to store and stamp each measurement data performed by the sensors. There will be only the measurement sequence information, previous time (clock) information, measurement data and its related data protocol information sent back to the Access Point (AP). This lead to less data transmission, less energy and less time required by the sensor nodes to operate and also leads to longer battery life time. The Visible Light Communication (VLC) is used, to provide energy, to synchronize time and to deliver the commands to the sensor nodes in the network. By employing star network topology, a part of solar cell as receiver, the conventional receiver (RF/Infrared) is neglected to reduce amount of hardware and energy consumption. The infrared transmitter on the sensor node is deployed to minimize the electromagnetic interference in the launcher and does not require a complicated circuit in comparison to a RF transmitter.},

abstract={This paper presents an 8 channel neural stimulator ASIC for biphasic stimulation of the visual cortex, realized in a 0.35 μm AMS HV process. Each channel is composed of an SPI interface, an 8-bit current digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and 120 V compliant HV output stage. Thus it is possible to deliver to the tissue arbitrary current waveforms with amplitudes up to ±10.24 mA with 40 μA steps. According to the simulation results the maximum differential non-linearity is equal to 0.27 LSB. The on board current reference provides the output current of 16 μA with the variation of 90 ppm/°C in the temperature range of 0-85° C. While the anodic and cathodic currents mismatch does not exceed 13 μA. The HV output interface of the ASIC was previously fabricated and measured. The measured interpulse leakage current does not exceed 60 pA. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to present the first compression and reconstruction methodology based on patch ordering inpainting algorithm for monitoring neural activity. This novel in-painting approach is especially important for the technical realization of implantable neural measurement systems (NMS) since they are subject to strict resource limitations as area and energy consumption. Intersection masks with center square as well as random-based masks are utilized for suitable neural data compression considering the patch ordering inpainting. The proposed inpainting methodology outperforms the structure-based inpainting algorithm and often applied Compressed Sensing strategy with regard to reconstruction quality of the real measured neural signals. These algorithms focus on complexity reduction according to hardware on im-plantable NMS. At high degrees of compression, the patch ordering inpainting yields well-suited or equal reconstruction results in contrast to JPEG or JPEG2000, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Scaled down CMOS transistors are prone to degradation and process variation. This necessitates a transistor model that provides an insight into the internal dependencies between these two crucial effects. Models for modern transistors and their degradation behavior are hardly attachable. This paper proposes a modified BSIM6 model which includes degradation due to BTI and HCI and in addition process variations. The application of this method is demonstrated on the basis of a single MOSFET and an inverter stage. The results can be used in the gm/Id work flow or for yield estimation on circuit level. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we investigate the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the Infrared (Ir) Communication inside the Vehicle Equipment Bay (VEB) of the ARIANE 5. Measurements were performed to find the impact of the reflection of the infrared signal via Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) on the infrared wireless sensor network (Ir WSN) communication in the VEB. The main focus is to find the relationship between the BER and the transmitting/receiving angle depending on variation of the Ir transmitter power. A further experiment was done by varying the transmission current with a constant angle for BER estimation without adding extra special signals (e.g. Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)) to the transmitter. Ambient white light from LEDs and 50 Hz fluorescent AC light was superimposed in the measurement to introduce additional noise for the infrared receiver into the physical channel. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work the design of low power infrared transceiver ASIC with AMS350nm technology is presented. There are two different types of transceiver designs that have been developed. The first design is based on IrDA 9600 baud serial infrared (SIR) standard physical signal layer that uses split-phase Manchester coding technique and the second design is using uni-polar return zero coding (RZ) technique. The prototypes of the circuit are built and tested on a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Spartan-3E board provided by Digilent. After finishing the prototype, the ASIC synthesized, manufactured and tested. The infrared transceiver ASIC is intended for infrared sensor communication inside ARIANE launcher. Instead of using commercial infrared transceiver ICs, the ASIC design in this work is used as a blue print for radiation hardened ASIC design that can be qualified for the space environments. Other aspects such as Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) with launcher electrical equipment are also considered in the frame of the ASIC development. © 2016 IEEE.},

With a generated stochastic Look-Up table the small signal characteristics of transistors and circuits can be predicted.

abstract={The precise measurement of acceleration is usually performed by MEMS capacitive sensors, which provide very low signal amplitudes. Therefore, a robust and highly accurate read-out system is required to process these output signals. In this paper we present an innovative concept for relaxing the requirements on the analog components of the read-out system by using digital calibration techniques. The design uses adaptive filters in a correlation-based calibration system, which continuously detects errors and corrects the digital output signal without interrupting normal sensor activities. Permanent and time-variant linear gain errors can be corrected and the complete sensor system becomes more robust against changing ambient conditions. The proposed concept has been successfully verified to correct different gain errors in a 350nm CMOS sensor interface. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Automated design of two-variable numeric functions can be realized efficiently by extending well-known multiplier-less linear function approximation techniques; the arithmetic signal processing effort is minimized by the utilization of a non-uniform piecewise segmentation scheme. However, as common state-of-the-art approaches only consider unpretentious coefficient estimation techniques, such as gradient superposition, this results in large multiplexer-trees for segmentation that, consequently, are restricting the total performance. In this paper a least-squares-based estimation of multiplier-less linear coefficients is introduced that minimizes the number of segments by using a least-squares-based coefficient estimation. The evaluation indicates a reduction of the segmentation effort by nearly 31% on average. Logical and physical CMOS synthesis is performed and the results are compared to actual references highlighting our work high performance approach for the hardware-based calculation of two-variable numeric functions. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper a new switched reference stimulator architecture for the visual cortex stimulation is presented. Compared with the present alternatives the architecture allows to relax twice requirements of the stimulator output voltage tolerance and to simplify the design of high voltage (HV) switches. The stimulator functionality was proven by fabrication with AMS HV 0.35 μm CMOS technology and the measurement of test chip. The measurement results show the possibility to drive currents from -10 mA up to 10 mA into the tissue, while the electrode-tissue interface resistance is up to 8 kω with the effectively high-voltage output compliance of up to 180 V. Wherein the need for HV VDD voltage is limited to 90 V. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for compressing neural signals. This topic is especially important for the realization of implantable neural measurement systems (NMS) since they are subject to strict constraints with regard to area and energy consumption. The handling of high data rate becomes a major topic within NMS. Compared to the often applied Compressed Sensing (CS) technique an approach steaming from image restoration is applied to NMS in this work for the first time: Inpainting strategies. The proposed Inpainting approach as well as CS focus on resource efficiency on transmitter (Tx) side in NMS. It can be shown, that the proposed approach outperforms CS in terms of recovery quality and thus is a promising alternative for the realization of innovative reliable NMS. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present a tool based approach for an aging-aware design method. Extending the gm/ID sizing method by operating point-dependent degradation caused by BTI and HCD enables an innovative design flow. This design flow considers performance characteristics for a fresh circuit and also those of a degraded circuit at design time. Once the degradation from a single transistor is computed, the GMID-Tool does not need any further SPICE or aging simulation. The impact of the change in design methodology is shown for a typical differential amplifier structure.

abstract={In this paper a novel method for hardware-based realization of two-variable numeric functions is introduced. The main idea is based on the extension of the well-known piecewise linear approximation technique, which is often used for the calculation of one-variable elementary functions. A nonuniform and plane segmentation scheme enables quick segment access at runtime; the use of multiplier-less linear equations causes high performance in terms of throughput. As both the extraction of approximation-related parameters and its mapping to corresponding hardware elements is automated, the design time is also reduced to a minimum. For evaluation, several approximations with varying constraints are generated and compared on the algorithmic level to one another as well as to actual references. In conjunction with the results of logical and physical CMOS synthesis, our work turns out to be highly efficient in terms of throughput, memory requirements and energy consumption. © 2015 EDAA.},

In detail, the angle of rotation and its application to the Givens-Matrix are processed in a direct, straightforward manner. High-performance signal processing is achieved by piecewise approximation of the arctangent and sine function. In order to identify appropriate function approximations, several designs with varying constraints are automatically generated and analyzed. Physical and logical synthesis is performed in a 130 nm CMOS-technology.

abstract={For safety-critical applications with long operational lifetimes the analysis of aging aspects caused by NBTI and HCD is moving into the focus of the designer. The increasing complexity of modern analog and mixed-signal circuits makes a reliability analysis on transistor level for complex systems quite challenging. In this paper we present a method using Box-Behnken Designs and Response Surface Modeling with exponential function interpolation. This approach enables accelerated reliability analysis on system level. A tool is introduced to support the behavioral model generation process. The derived model includes information on degradation and process variations. The method is demonstrated for a current-mirror and a CS amplifier to quantify the degradation influence. The accuracy of the behavioral models and the age-dependent yield of the circuits is determined. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The design and fabrication of fully-implantable neural measurement systems has been enabled by the continuous miniaturization and increasing integration density of modern CMOS technologies. The use of CMOS processes with small structure sizes benefits the energy consumption and the functionality of modern neural recording systems. However, the miniaturization increases the impact of degradation effects as well as the influence of variations. New EDA and modeling approaches have to be investigated in order to enable designers to simulate these effects already during the design phase of complex safety-critical applications. The aim of this paper is to present a new approach for the variability- and aging-aware behavioral model generation of analog components. The modeling is demonstrated on a neural amplifier topology in order to show the proposed design flow. For the investigated amplifier a simulation speedup of 110× compared to transistor level simulation could be obtained by still achieving a small error in mean value and standard deviation of the modeled performances. The variability-and aging-aware modeling is applied to an analog recording front-end as part of a neural measurement implant and enables the analysis of the expected system reliability over time. For the detection of neural action potentials a decrease in system performance of about 0.26 % due to aging influence is observed. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={MEMS inertial sensors based on capacitive comb electrodes provide very low signal amplitudes. To accurately process these signals, the connected read-out system needs to be robust against process, voltage and temperature variation. This is accomplished through digital calibration techniques, which use adaptive linear filters to correct the digital output signal. In this paper we expand the digital calibration part to introduce an innovative monitor concept for process variability. By using the signal of an available temperature sensor and the filter coefficients of the calibration system, a measure for the influence of process variability is provided. The proposed concept has successfully been verified to monitor process corners in a 350nm CMOS sensor interface. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The basic challenge in embedding sensors in materials is to meet simultaneously two conflicting requirements; on one hand, we want to retrieve sensor data from the material and thus we have to integrate sensors, electronics, and interconnections. On the other hand, sensors are foreign bodies in the material, which may deteriorate its macroscopic properties. This paper discusses several possibilities to integrate sensors in material in a minimal invasive way, avoiding subsequent deterioration of its macroscopic performance. It is our idea to adapt the integrated sensor to the surrounding matrix and to reduce sensors volume to the minimum, which is needed to guarantee the function. This approach is called function scale integration. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Analog design is facing new challenges as reliability requirements are increasingly moving into focus for target specifications. Methods providing a degradation-aware design flow exist, but mostly involve algorithmic optimization and lack of computational efficiency and circuit insight. This paper proposes the use of aging-aware sensitivity maps generated by operating point-dependent degradation within the gm/Id scheme. Sensitivity values proof to be a good measure for circuit degradation. Different designs of a common source amplifier structure are investigated by comparing aging sensitivities and simulated degradation. The results show that in opposition to existing methods this technique enables aging-aware design during design phase with comparatively low computational effort. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The measurement of neural signals is mandatory for an extensive and detailed understanding of the cortex. A parallel recording of multiple recording channels and varying neural signal types is required in order to cover a high density of neural information. Therefore, analog front-ends are required which record signals from the micro-mechanical electrodes and preprocesses these data for a transmission out of the brain. This paper presents an analog front-end for the recording of local field potentials and neural spikes. A modular approach is applied that enables the integration within a complete system or the operation as a single component. The use of configurable recording channels provides the capability to adjust the channels, dependent on the signal type of interest. The proposed front-end has been fabricated in a 0.35 μm-CMOS process, and performance values are demonstrated by measurements. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Analog circuit performance are degrading by effects like HCI and NBTI. These performance shifts need to be evaluated by the designer to meet given specifications. The evaluation on transistor level enables an accurate prediction of degradation behavior for a chosen circuit. However, this task is very time-consuming for complex analog circuitry. This paper proposes the use of response surface modeling for age-dependent degradation. The generated model is used to extend analog behavioral descriptions and for an accelerated system level analysis. The proposed age-dependent degradation model is demonstrated on a common source amplifier and an analog frontend for the measurement of neural activities. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and simulation acceleration of the proposed modeling method. © 2014 Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science.},

abstract={In this paper we consider physical-layer network coding (PLNC) in OFDM-based two-way relaying systems. Practically, a key impairment for the application of PLNC is the carrier frequency offset (CFO) mismatch between the sources and the relay, which can not be compensated completely in the multiple-access (MA) phase. As this CFO mismatch results in inter-carrier interference (ICI) for OFDM transmissions, practical CFO compensation and ICI cancelation strategies are investigated to mitigate the impairment for a-posterior probability (APP) based PLNC decoders at the relay. Furthermore, we perform hardware implementation of the two-way relaying network employing an long term evolution (LTE) near parametrization adapted to PLNC. The APP-based decoding schemes with CFO compensation and ICI cancelation are applied on this real-time transmission platform to verify the analytical results. © VDE Verlag GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={Machine-type communications are quite often of very low data rate and of sporadic nature and therefore not well-suited for nowadays high data rate cellular communication systems. Since signaling overhead must be reasonable in relation to message size, research towards joint activity and data estimation was initiated. When the detection of sporadic multi-user signals is modeled as a sparse vector recovery problem, signaling concerning node activity can be avoided as it was demonstrated in previous works. In this paper we show how well-known K-Best detection can be modified to approximately solve this finite alphabet Compressed Sensing problem. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust against parameter variations and even works in cases where fewer measurements than unknown sources are available. © 2014 EURASIP.},

abstract={The recording of neural activities has turned out to be a promising approach to understand the basic function of specific brain parts like the visual or motor cortex. However, the development and design of advanced neural recording systems is very challenging since the number of parallel measurement channels increases continuously. Beside the analog recording channels digital preprocessing becomes mandatory to handle the corresponding amount of data and to adapt this data to the available transmission bandwidth. In this paper we present the design as well as the behavioral modeling of an analog recording front-end. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate the performances of the system for recording neural signals. Since simulation of this analog front-end is very time consuming but essential for large fully-integrated designs, a mixed-signal model approach is introduced that enables a significant simulation acceleration of integrated and external analog front-ends. The simulation can be accelerated by a factor of up to 22.2 for a single front-end. The proposed system has been fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology and performances have been measured. This demonstrates that the behavioral model is compatible to the transistor level design. A neural spike detector shows the transient performance of the modeled design on real input stimuli. © 2014 EDAA.},

abstract={Progress in invasive brain research relies on signal acquisition at high temporal- and spatial resolutions, resulting in a data deluge at the (wireless) interface to the external world. Hence, data compression at the implant site is necessary in order to comply with the neurophysiological restrictions, especially when it comes to recording and transmission of neural raw data. This work investigates spatial correlations of neural signals, leading to a significant increase in data compression with a suitable sparse signal representation before the wireless data transmission at the implant site. Subsequently, we used the correlation-aware two-dimensional DCT used in image processing, to exploit spatial correlation of the data set.

abstract={For a design which is tolerant to parameter variations caused by process, voltage, temperature and aging, precise monitoring of the reliability status becomes a prerequisite. In applications such as medical implants reliability in combination with power efficiency is a crucial design goal. In the monitoring approach presented in this paper, circuit level timing properties are measured and utilized for reliability diagnosis. In situ timing monitors are inserted and fabricated within the digital front end of a neural measurement system. The monitors can distinguish between critical and relaxed operation. Extracted timing information is used for on-line adaptation of the supply voltage in order to reduce aging as well as the power consumption of the implants. The supply voltage of the digital circuitry is decreased to the minimum possible value, while ensuring reliable operation of the circuit. The quantitative evaluations on simulation and measurement results support the applicability of the proposed monitoring methodology for the neural measurement system. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Systems for intracortical recording of neural activities underly strict reliability requirements. The system should operate without any dysfunction for at least one decade. Despite process variability also NBTI and CHC will introduce performance shifts, which need to be evaluated by the system designer. In order to estimate the lifetime the system, reliability figures need to be calculated. By reconfiguring netlists it is possible to combine Monte Carlo analysis and aging simulation.

abstract={The combination of OFDM with joint pre-processing in adaptive multi-antenna systems offers both an ease of equalization in frequency-selective channels and keeping the signal processing at the mobile stations simple. In addition, the spatial dimension can be efficiently exploited to ensure high system throughput. With the utilization of higher-order modulation the performance of the system is highly sensitive to multiple access interference and nonorthogonal subchannels due to hardware impairments or insufficient adaptation to the current channel conditions. A further source of error in TDD systems are the non-reciprocal transceivers inhibiting the baseband-to-baseband channel reciprocity required for accurate channel state acquisition based on the uplink channel estimate. In this paper, measurement results of a low-cost hardware-based calibration are presented and the drawbacks are discussed leading to the utilization of a recently introduced relative calibration. The latter is applied to an OFDM system and achieves or at least approximates the baseband-to-baseband reciprocity. Thus, it enables the link adaptation using the uplink channel state information. Furthermore, preliminary hardware implementations of the relative calibration running on a real-time system show accurate results. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a QR-decomposition hardware implementation that processes complex calculations in the logarithmic number system. Thus, low complexity numeric format converters are installed, using nonuniform piecewise and multiplier-less function approximation. The proposed algorithm is simulated with several different configurations in a downlink precoding environment for 4×4 and 8×8 multi-antenna wireless communication systems. In addition, the results are compared to default CORDIC-based architectures. In a second step, HDL implementation as well as logical and physical CMOS synthesis are performed. The comparison to actual references highlight our approach as highly efficient in terms of hardware complexity and accuracy. © 2013 EDAA.},

abstract={Effects like NBTI and HCI are degrading the characteristics of analog circuits. Available countermeasures to maintain system performances often include the use of optimizers or other external tools to size devices appropriately, which give no insight in relations between degradation and circuit parameters for the designer. This paper proposes an extension of the gm/ID sizing method by considering aged transistor parameters for fresh circuit design. A possible usage scenario for this investigation is given by optimizing a simple circuit towards higher reliability. The degradation in amplification of a common source amplifier is reduced by 19 % for a full time operation of 10 years. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={NBTI and HCI are not only present in digital circuits but also in analog circuitry. Integrated circuit amplifiers as used in neural measurement systems (NMS) need to be resistive against degradation since these systems cannot be replaced easily. A topology driven design methodology to increase the reliability of amplifiers used for intracortical neural recording has been proposed in this work. This approach leads to a decrease in degradation for some system performances by a factor of three. It has been shown that the degradation of a circuit is highly dependent on the selected current mirror and biasing circuit. © 2013 EDAA.},

abstract={Brain research is concerned with two types of electrophysiological signals: neural action potentials (AP), which are also known as spikes, and local field potentials (LFP). The demand for an increased spatial and temporal resolution leads to an enlarged data rate which has to be handled by an assumed wireless link between the signal sources and the base station. Without data compression, these data rates would conflicting the neurophysiological restrictions in terms of low energy and low area consumption. The theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) can be utilized to perform data compression right after or during the acquisition of the neural data. In order to apply a joint CS infrastructure to AP and LFP, a common basis in which both signal types can be characterized as sufficiently sparse has to be found. In this paper, we investigate and compare four different well-known bases for the joint compression of LFP and AP of which the discrete cosine transform (DCT) turns out to be best suited. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Vegetables, fruits and fish are very sensitive to variations in environmental conditions. To avoid a significant waste of goods during transportation the temperature and the humidity have to be set close to a predetermined point by the cooling unit of the container. Continuous and precise monitoring of physical parameters is therefore an important task to reduce the amount of spoiled goods. To supervise the container status the monitored data have to be evaluated and transmitted to the end-user. A graphical interface enables the setting and analysis of essential parameters and the supervision of the load quality. In this paper a low-power UHF / LF sensor system with a web-based remote supervision is presented. The system consists of wireless low power sensor nodes, a base station and corresponding antennas. A supervision unit is implemented for freight quality monitoring and for transmitting commands to dedicated sensor IDs. A web-based interface in combination with a virtual private network is used to establish a connection to the container and to control relevant parameters and evaluate data acquired by the sensor nodes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully implantable neural recording system for the simultaneous recording of 128 channels. The electrocorticography (ECoG) signals are sensed with 128 gold electrodes embedded in a 10 μ.m thick polyimide foil. The signals are picked up by eight amplifier array ICs and digitized with a resolution of 16 bit at 10 kHz. The digitized measurement data is processed in a reconfigurable digital ASIC, which is fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology and occupies an area of 2.8 × 2.8 mm2. After data reduction, the measurement data is fed into a transceiver IC, which transmits the data with up to 495 kbit/s to a base station, using an RF loop antenna on a flexible PCB. The power consumption of 84 mW is delivered via inductive coupling from the base station. © 2013 EDAA.},

abstract={In this paper the implementation of an application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) designed for online monitoring of perishable cargo freight is presented. It benefits flexible signal processing, considering actual environmental influences. As the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) has turned out to achieve convenient and efficient results, it is adapted to this application. Complex algebraic functions are realized by nonuniform linear piecewise function approximation as this increases computation effort and as a consequence energy-efficiency.

abstract={Multiuser detection can be implemented at the sink of a sensor network to receive the various signals of its sensor nodes. This is a viable approach as long as the number of sensor nodes is small. In case of many nodes, decoding can be considered technically infeasible, but assuming low transmission activities, the sparse nature of the sensor signals can be utilized. In this paper, we propose a sphere decoding algorithm to perform maximum likelihood decoding based on an extended distance metric that takes the a priori probability into account. By intentionally violating the ideal check of the sphere constraint, many improbable transmit hypotheses can be dismissed early, thus reducing decoding complexity but without notable loss of quality. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Time and frequency synchronisation are significant parts of the cell-search procedure and one of the first processing blocks within a mobile communication system. Particularly for an OFDM transmission within an initial synchronisation process, the algorithm has to deal with carrier frequency offsets up to several subcarrier spacings. To be able to still operate under those conditions, the cell-search procedure consists of different processing steps, combined in a hybrid algorithm. Beside good performance properties, hybrid algorithms lead to a high computational demand and implementation effort. To overcome these challenges, flexible architectures, which are able to select the most suitable algorithm during runtime, are the base for an efficient hardware realization. In this paper, as an example, we are introducing an hybrid initial synchronisation algorithm for an LTE-system, which still operates under the effect of a carrier frequency offset greater than the subcarrier spacing. Consecutively, we are showing a reconfigurable architecture as well as the results of an FPGA implementation of the time synchronisation part of that algorithm. The architecture is able to switch between different correlators, namely a reverse-auto, a cross- and a CP-based auto-correlation during runtime, which enables a flexible and low complexity realization of the computational complex synchronisation process. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) modulation has become increasingly important for actual and future mobile communication systems [1]. Within this scope, Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) compensation is indispensable [2]. Its underlying algorithm requires the calculation of trigonometric functions, which is difficult to achieve by hardware implementation in general. In this paper we propose a CFO compensation approach based on low complexity and hardware optimized linear function approximation. The Multiplier-less nonuniform Piecewise function Approximation (MPA) methodology significantly reduces the calculation effort of crucial algebraic terms. Matlab simulation is performed in order to prove the results in terms of feasibility. The compensation algorithm is also implemented in VHDL and synthesized as hard-wired Integrated Circuit (IC). A chip area of 0.034mm2, a frequency of 181MHz and a total power consumption of 18.62μW/MHz are obtained. © 2012 EURASIP.},

abstract={Mobile communication needs battery energy. There is always a trade-off between power consumption and bit-error performance. To investigate this, power modeling of the hardware components is necessary. In this paper, a baseband energy model for VLSI design optimization considering both dynamic and static energy consumption for wireless application with short distance is introduced. Due to the trade-off between dynamic and static energy consumption of CMOS gates, a new design rule for energy aware implementation is presented. As an example, the hardware design of an FFT block is analyzed. Over 70% of the energy is saved after the optimization using the presented energy model. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider a two-hop distributed relaying network using orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC), where several relays using Decode-Forward (DF) support the transmission from one source to one destination. In order to mitigate the impact of error propagation for DF, an inter-relay cooperation (IRC) scheme allowing message exchanges among the relays was presented in our previous work based on punctured channel codes. Specifically, one of the relays that decodes the source message correctly re-generates and broadcasts the punctured bits as side information to support the relays with decoding errors for re-decoding. Subsequently, only the error-free relays transmit to the destination using OSTBC. It was shown that this IRC scheme may increase the number of error-free relays when at least one relay decodes the source message correctly. In this paper we focus on the scenario that all relays fail to decode the source message correctly. To this end, an improved IRC scheme is presented based on received signal exchange, in which the whole or part of the received frame are exchanged among the relays to apply signal combining. Additionally, the total energy consumption for signal transmission, baseband processing and RF circuit at all relays is evaluated for practical preferences. It is shown that the improved scheme outperforms our original scheme significantly with respect to the overall system throughput. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={MIMO detectors are one of the most complex parts within a wireless communication system. In particular, for high throughput communication standards, like the 3GPP Long Term Evolution, reduced complexity detectors, which achieve a good BER performance are of major interest. Sphere decoder algorithms are one kind of tree search algorithms, which offer a good complexity-performance trade-off. In this paper we introduce a novel computation unit for a sphere decoder algorithm, which achieves an identical behavior compared to a complex sphere decoder, in terms of the BER performance and the number of visited nodes, by a reduced computational complexity. This is achieved due to calculating the Partial Euclidean Distance of the real and the imaginary part of a partial symbol vector totally independently from each other. For example, the number of adders is reduced by about 46% and the signal propagation delay is cut down by one adder stage for the computation unit. Furthermore, the comparator elements of the minimum unit are reduced by 60% and the signal propagation delay is cut down by two comparator stages. © 2012 VDE VERLAG GMBH.},

abstract={This paper presents a localization system for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) based on ultrasonic (US) Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements. The participants send out US pulses while a central localization unit measures the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) between four US sensors to calculate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA). The radio frequency (RF) transceiver of the sensor nodes enables distance measurements using TDoA (US vs. RF) in addition. This improves the localization accuracy significantly since the estimated distance from triangulation suffers excessively from even small angle errors. Several filter stages including Kalman-filtering minimize the number of outliers and fluctuations of the calculated distances and angles. Those computed polar coordinates (angle / distance) are converted into a Cartesian form and forwarded to a base station which is connected to a PC. The mean error and standard deviation of the angle and distance measurements (1.36 ° ± 0.39 ° / 1.00 cm ± 0.14 cm) lead to a small mean localization error of 4.21 cm and a standard deviation of 0.57 cm. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Perishables need special conditions within the food supply chain like temperature or humidity. There is a lack of information along the food supply chain (FSC) concerning temperatures for perishable goods. By integrating the Intelligent Container (IC) within the Internet of Things the lack of information will be eliminated and thus wastes of food will be reduced. The first step for this integration is to analyze common techniques in modeling supply chains and especially the FSC and create a model taking into consideration the concept of the IC. On this basis, technologies to generate information along the FSC are shown and the IC is linked to the Internet of Things. Finally, a logistic reference model will be deduced from the Internet of Things for perishables. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the Multiple Input Multiple Output technology, applied in wireless communication, where a transceiver has to deal with multidimensional channels, the QR-decomposition is an often used preprocessing algorithm, especially for the design of iterative tree search detection algorithms. In this paper we introduce an efficient FPGA implementation of a QR-decomposition algorithm, which is designed for a MIMO detector developed in view of the Long Term Evolution (LTE). The proposed architecture is based on a line-by-line systolic array structure and reaches the peak matrix throughput, which is required to achieve the defined LTE peak data rate of a 2 x 2 MIMO constellation using a 20 MHz transmission bandwidth. In this paper we describe the architecture and FPGA implementation of the algorithm in detail and show the performance results of a Xilinx Virtex IV realization. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={To meet the requirements of modern, high throughput communication systems, like the 3GPP Long Term Evolution, which aims to achieve a peak throughput of 100 Mbit/s in the downlink and 50 Mbit/s in the uplink, MIMO is a key technology. Therefore, efficient MIMO detection algorithms have become of major interest. Iterative tree-search detectors offer a good trade-off between the computational complexity and the BER performance. All these detectors assume a QR decomposed channel matrix to transform the Maximum Likelihood problem into a tree structure and to define a criterion to prune branches early. This criterion can be described by the Partial Euclidean Distance. In this paper we consider an iterative tree-search detector, namely a K-best detector, in combination with a specific QR-decomposition algorithm to formulate a Modified Partial Euclidean Distance and to avoid square roots and divisions, which normally appear due to the QR-decomposition. Hence, in opposite to an usual, separate algorithm optimization, a combined optimization is described. © 2011 IEEE.},

The approach is developed based on observations of numerous practical experiments within wireless sensor networks. The method detects the battery exhaustion by simply evaluating the reliability of temperature and humidity readings. The nodes can block autonomously the unreliable readings due to the low voltage at an optimal time point. The recommended operation voltage threshold of the SHT-sensor is 2.4 V [1]. The experiments show that the sensor can deliver the sink reliable readings below this threshold for a further considerably long time range.

abstract={We consider distributed relaying networks using space-time block codes (STBC) to exploit cooperative diversity. In order to mitigate the impact of error propagation for Decode-Forward (DF), an inter-relay cooperation (IRC) scheme is proposed that allows message exchanges between the relays based on punctured channel codes. Specifically, one of the error-free relays broadcasts punctured bits as side information to help failed relays to re-decode. Consequently, only relays capable of successful decoding transmit to the destination using STBC. Furthermore, an energy model for relays is introduced, so that the proposed IRC scheme can be evaluated with respect to throughput and energy consumptions for transmission, baseband and RF circuit at all relays. Simulation results show the superior performance using IRC, which should be properly designed under the influence of energy considerations. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Environmental monitoring performed by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in wireless sensor networks (WSN) has turned out to be a suitable application [1]. Its main advantage is high accuracy prediction of environmental parameters, such as temperature or humidity [2]. Although predictors reduce in general the transceiver energy, their corresponding algorithm requires high calculation effort that may nullify this benefit. In order to decrease crucial mathematical terms of the original ANN algorithm, this work focuses on simplification by means of Equidistant Piecewise function Approximation (EPA). Thus, we split up the sigmoid function, which is used as activation function inside the ANN network, into several equidistant segments. The function slope inside each segment is replaced by a linear equation approximation. This minimizes the overall energy consumption as the calculation effort is reduced distinctly. For validation, our proposal has been implemented on a TelosB [3] sensor node (SN) where detailed evaluation and analysis of the EPA based ANN predictor is performed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for dynamic controlling of the communication process within cluster-based wireless sensor networks (WSN). The research concentrates on the environmental parameters supervision with WSN inside a container. In order to maintain the requisite environmental sensing quality with as low energy consumption as possible, the participants of WSN make distributed decisions about their own communication intensity according to the surrounding environmental conditions. For this purpose, the cluster head (CH) and cluster member (CM) apply a collaborative decision-making approach to control the transmission activity of each CM. The CH turns the spatially redundant CMs off by observing the relationship between sensor data from all CMs. The CMs apply dynamic sensing rate approach to reduce the temporally redundant sensor data as well as to reactive itself from sleep mode. The simulation results show that the collaborative approach performs high sensing quality in spite of drastic reduction of communication activities. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Since Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) transmission has become more and more popular for current and future mobile communication systems, MIMO detection is a big issue. Linear detection algorithms are less complex and well understood but their BER performance is limited. ML detectors achieve the optimum result but have exponential computational complexity. Hence, iterative tree-search algorithms like the sphere decoder or the K-Best detector, which reduce the computational complexity, has become a major topic in research. In this paper a modified K+-Best detector is introduced which is able to achieve the BER performance of a common K-Best detector with K=12, by using a sorting algorithm for K=8. This novel sorting approach based on Batchers Odd-Even Mergesort is less complex compared to other parallel sorting designs and saves valuable hardware resources. Due to an efficient implementation the throughput of the detector is about 455 Mbit/s which is twice as high as the LTE peak data rate of 217.6 Mbit/s for a 16-QAM modulated signal. In this paper the architecture and the implementation issues are demonstrated in detail and the BER performance of the K+-Best FPGA implementation is shown. © 2011 EDAA.},

abstract={The impact of power efficient wireless sensor networks (WSN) is getting more and more important, as it is built of battery driven sensor nodes (SN). Besides, common low power techniques like voltage scaling, variable-rate sampling (VRS) has been exposed as an adequate possibility to minimize the transceiver activity [1]. In this paper a high performance algorithm based on an artificial neural network structure (ANN) for WSN applications is presented which delivers adequate function course prediction, necessary for most precise sampling interval adjustment as described in [2]. Our approach is based on approximation by means of adjustment theory in detail linear regression [3] and algorithm adaption to the underlying low power TelosB SN hardware [4]. It is further implemented in the efficient fixed-point number format, and its experimental results are compared to common prediction algorithms.},

abstract={Programmability is a welcome feature to use hardware modules in different products. However, in mobile applications power consumption is an important limitation. Very complex algorithms can be found in wireless communication that require efficient processing considering computation performance as well as power consumption [1]. For the application area of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) signal detection, Sphere Decoding is a popular method. We pick several of those algorithms with similar basic instructions and design an application specific instruction set processor (ASIP). We show the optimized microarchitecture of the data path and the defined instruction set. Further power reduction is achieved by low level power optimization methods. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.},

abstract={Synchronization is a major topic in OFDM. Small remaining timing offsets, which are less than the cyclic prefix, are commonly compensated by the equalizer in the receiver. Therefore, separate detection and compensation of the timing offset, especially the fractional timing offset is not mandatory. Considering a reciprocal communication system, i.e., the uplink channel is assumed to be equal to the transposed downlink channel, for example, downlink precoding can be done by using the estimated uplink channel matrix. In this case a small remaining timing offset, effecting the transfer matrix, corrupts the assumption of reciprocity, and this can cause degradations in the BER. In this paper we consider this effect and show how it can be compensated within the transfer matrix. Furthermore, we analyze in which way the effect differs for different systems mainly caused by the D/A-converter and interpolation filter. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper an empirical study about distance measurements with ultrasonic sensors within an intermodal container is presented. In a previous work [1] the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) was used for measuring the distance between two nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Since RSSI revealed a huge distance measurement error (52 cm) and standard deviation (47 cm) a Time-of-Flight (ToF) approach is applied. For this purpose self-developed ultrasonic sensor boards are equipped on the sensor nodes and a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) algorithm is implemented. Afterwards, the system is tested and calibrated to decrease the distance error. Then a multi stage filter, including Kalman filtering [2], is implemented to enhance the measurement stability. The following tests in the container reach a measuring accuracy around 1.5 cm with a standard deviation of 0.4 cm under the same environmental conditions.},

abstract={The introduction of digital intermediate workflow in movie production has made visualization of the final image on the film set increasingly important. Images that have been color corrected on the set can also serve as a basis for color grading in the laboratory. In this paper we suggest and evaluate an approach that has been used to simulate the appearance of different film stocks. The GretagMacbeth Digital ColorChecker was captured using both a Canon EOS 20D camera as well as an analog film camera. The film was scanned using an Arri film scanner. The images of the color chart were then used to perform a colorimetric characterization of these devices using models based on polynomial regression. By using the reverse model of the digital camera and the forward model of the analog film chain, the output of the film scanner was simulated. We also constructed a direct transformation using regression on the RGB values of the two devices. A different color chart was then used as a test set to evaluate the accuracy of the transformations, where the indirect model was found to provide the required performance for our purpose without compromising the flexibility of having an independent profile for each device. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={Signals transmitted over a multi-path propagation channel exhibit Inter-Path Interference (IPI) and fading. The receiver has to employ measures to mitigate these effects or it will incur severe performance degradation. A classic approach in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications is the Rake receiver. Alternatively, a Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) equalizer can further improve performance. This paper compares performance and computational complexity of these two algorithms. A hybrid solution will be introduced in order to decrease computational complexity while retaining most of the interference suppression capabilities of the LMMSE equalizer. © Author(s) 2008.},

abstract={This poster shows the work-in-progress results of an effective method for predicting the residual battery energy in WSN nodes including the battery behavior. This method uses a hybrid approach consisting of a deterministic part by counting credit points for any operation of the sensor node and a model-based State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation based on battery voltage and temperature. It is applied for Li-Ion accumulators on modified Tmote Sky motes. For demonstration purposes the method is used for cluster head selection in a cluster-based topology formation algorithm to ensure equal distribution of the cluster head role among the network nodes based on the residual energy.},

abstract={The development of MIMO techniques for UMTS is a major field of ongoing research at university and industry level. MIMO algorithms typically exhibit extremely high complexity. Therefore, the exploration of low-complexity solutions is highly desirable with respect to today's semiconductor technology implementations. A number of prototype systems and chip solutions have already been reported. Most of these solutions act on simplified assumptions, for example, flatfading channels. Nevertheless, these first prototypes are extremely helpful in identifying problems inherent to MIMO signal processing. Thus, they are driving the standardization process of UMTS MIMO systems. There is only little work available that specifically deals with MIMO compliant RF front ends. The straight forward approach of a MIMO RF front-end implementation is the use of a dedicated receiver per antenna. This approach shows significant area and power saving potential, and therefore tends to be the most favored technology.},

abstract={High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) using Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques received increasing attention recently, because MIMO-HSDPA allows capacity enlargement and, therefore, supports the demand of high data services, which are expected to become the dominant source of 3G traffic and of revenue in cellular communications in the next few years. This contribution will discuss one particular MIMO-HSDPA scheme - the Per Antenna Rate Control (PARC) - from the viewpoint of conventional receiver architectures. In addition, the Signal-to-Interference-Ratio (SIR) is introduced as a basic metric for the channel quality indication required in a PARC-based system, by briefly reviewing blind and data-aided SIR estimation methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we show by simulations that the interference generated by the Synchronization Channel (SCH) and Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) has considerable impact on the throughput of the High-Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) in UMTS. First, the simulation model for High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in UMTS is described. The downlink physical layer for the user data on the HS-PDSCH is modelled in detail, whereas the associated signalling is idealised as error-free. The interference from signalling and data channels on the HS-PDSCH is modelled adequately. As a general guideline for system setlings in the simulations, we use the test cases specified in 3GPP TS 25.101 [5] whenever applicable. Cancelling the SCH interference at the mobile side leads to an improvement of approx. 1 dB on an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Therefore, it is worthwhile to implement Interference Cancellation (IC) for the SCH and CPICH in future mobile receivers for HSDPA. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel adaptive space-time Rake receiver is proposed for UMTS frequency division duplex mode based on the adaptive minimum bit error rate (AMBER) criterion. The design of this space-time Rake receiver builds on previous results reported by Chen et al. for temporal or spatial processing, respectively. The original AMBER approach assumes short spreading sequences, i.e. they need to be invariant from symbol to symbol. Here we extend the approach to joint space-time processing and tailor the receiver specifically for a UMTS FDD system with long scrambling sequences in the uplink. The base station receiver uses a two- or four-element antenna array. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={A simple SRAM current sense amplifier with common gate input stage is presented. Instead of keeping the gate at constant potential it is controlled by the select signal of the bit line multiplexer (MUX). If the transistor is turned on it maintains a low input resistance while the off-state is used for multiplexing and power down. Experimental results in 0.18μm 1.8V CMOS show that the circuit is superior to conventional voltage sensing. It is shown that for supply voltages below IV where the driving cell currents become very small, only current sensing is capable of fast reading. For a 0.12μm technology the simulated lower supply voltage limit of the proposed circuit is as low as 0.4V. © 2001 IEEE.},

abstract={Current sensing in SRAMs is very promising to achieve high-speed operation in low-voltage applications. However, so far, a main limitation of the practical use of current sense amplifiers is the finite resistance of the bitline multiplexer (MUX). In this paper, the MUX itself and its influence on two types of current sense amplifiers is analyzed. It is shown that the MUX causes a significant performance degradation. A principle is presented to compensate for the bitline multiplexer by means of a current sense amplifier with improved feedback structure. The proposed solution is implemented in a 512 × 24 bit SRAM macro in 0.18-μm 1.8-V CMOS. It is shown by theory and measurements that, using the proposed circuit, it is possible to fully compensate for the MUX in terms of speed and signal amplitude with only little layout area penalty. A speed improvement due to the compensation of typically 0.5 ns is measured.},

abstract={Charging a capacitor from a voltage source with internal resistor is one of the basic problems in circuit theory. In recent years, this simple problem has attracted some interest in the area of low-power digital circuits. The efficiency, i.e., the energy stored in the capacitor versus the energy delivered by the source is one of the key measures. The common believe that the source has to deliver twice the capacitor energy holds true only for a linear circuit with step function as source voltage. In this paper we compute several optimal solutions with respect to time and efficiency. The case of nonlinear capacitors is discussed in some detail. The source voltage can depend on time in a rather involved manner. However, replacing the voltage source by a current source simplifies the problem significantly since the current has to be constant over time regardless of the characteristic of the capacitance. This result should have implications on the circuit technique employed for low-power circuits. Furthermore, if leak conductances in parallel to the capacitor are taken into account, the achievable minimal energy dissipation is limited and, if ramps are used for charging, an optimal charging time different from infinity occurs.},

In [2], [3], [4], [5] the branch-based logic is described as a promising CMOS logic style with iow-power advantages over complementary CMOS with topologicai dua! PMOS- and NMOS-networks. In addition, the branch-based logic is said to enable a more compact layout on chip. These statements are based on comparisons made several years ago using a 2 μm technology and have not been proven for sub-micron technologies yet. This paper analyzes the branch-based logic for a 0.25 μm state of the art industrial technology and shows that in most cases it is inferior to topologicai dual CMOS, con- cerning power consumption as weil as layout area.},

abstract={The Jacobi method for singular value decomposition is well-suited for parallel architectures. Its application to signal subspace computations is well known. Basically the subspace spanned by singular vectors of large singular values are separated from subspace spanned by those of small singular values. The Jacobi algorithm computes the singular values and the corresponding vectors in random order. This requires sorting the result after convergence of the algorithm to select the signal subspace. A modification of the Jacobi method based on a linear objective function merges the sorting into the SVD-algorithm at little extra cost. In fact, the complexity of the diagonal processor cells in a triangular array get slightly larger. In this paper we present these extensions, in particular the modified algorithm for computing the rotation angles and give an example of its usefulness for subspace separation.},

abstract={Numerical algorithms for signal processing and control are quite often constructed by intuition. When the system to be designed contains algebraic or other invariants, then these constraints can be exploited to find appropriate transformations. The transformations in system theory are usually Lie groups. One has to find Lie groups which are consistent with the invariants. We show how this point of view can be applied to construct pole placement algorithms for symmetric and skew-symmetric realizations. However, Lie group theory only reveals the appropriate transformations but is not able to reduce the design process to a trivial task. The problem discussed here also shows this limitation.},

abstract={The main task in rank filtering and many other nonlinear filtering operations is sorting. In this paper, a nonlinear dynamical system for this operation is proposed. The sorting problem is embedded in a higher dimensional matrix-valued problem. An equivalent analog circuit consists of basic building blocks like adders, multipliers, and integrators which set up basic nonlinear processing cells. These processing cells are locally connected in a one-dimensional array of length N for a rank filter, with N input data elements taken as the initial values of the dynamical system. The time for sorting can be estimated theoretically and indicates fast convergence. In time complexity, the algorithm is of O(N). As opposed to a digital rank filter, the analog rank filter possesses a parameter to control the speed of convergence and the accuracy. © 1993 IEEE},

abstract={A very fast Jacobi-like algorithm for the parallel solution of symmetric eigenvalue problems is proposed. It becomes possible by not focusing on the realization of the Jacobi rotation with a CORDIC processor, but by applying approximate rotations and adjusting them to single steps of the CORDIC algorithm, i.e., only one angle of the CORDIC angle sequence defines the Jacobi rotation in each step. This angle can be determined by some shift, add and compare operations. Although only linear convergence is obtained for the most simple version of the new algorithm, the overall operation count (shifts and adds) decreases dramatically. A slow increase of the number of involved CORDIC angles during the runtime retains quadratic convergence. © 1993 IEEE},

abstract={In the last years completely integrable Hamiltonian systems were of great interest because of their physical nature, e.g., the existence of soliton solutions, and their relation to eigenvalue and sorting problems. But until recently, they found little interest among electrical engineers because lossless circuits are difficult to realize as physical systems. However, if we are only interested in the “signals” associated with Hamiltonian systems, and not in conserving the energy in the individual circuit elements (nonlinear inductors and capacitors), then such systems can be built as analog circuits which implement some signal flow graphs. Under certain restrictions, cellular neural networks (CNN’s) come very close to some Hamiltonian systems; therefore, they are potentially useful for simulating or realizing such systems. In this paper, we will show how to map two one-dimensional nonlinear lattices, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice and the Toda lattice, onto a CNN. We demonstrate for the Toda lattice what happens if the signals are driven beyond the linear region of the output function. Though the system is no longer Hamiltonian, numerical experiments reveal the existence of solitons for special initial conditions. This interesting phenomenon is due to a special symmetry in the CNN system of ODE’s. © 1993 IEEE},

abstract={A very fast CORDIC-based Jacobi-like algorithm for the parallel solution of symmetric eigenvalue problems is proposed. It becomes possible by not focussing on the realization of an exact Jacobi rotation with a CORDIC processor, but by applying approximate rotations and adjusting them to single steps of the CORDIC algorithm, i.e. only one angle of the CORDIC angle sequence is applied in each step. Although only linear convergence is obtained for the most simple version of the new algorithm, the overall operation count (shifts and adds) decreases dramatically. A slow increase of the number of involved CORDIC angles during the runtime retains quadratic convergence.},

abstract={Nonlinear wave equations can be investigated either by numerical simulations with the aid of a model of computation or by building an equivalent electrical circuit with concentrated network elements. In both cases it is of great importance to find a model being close to the physical reality. Since the model is an approximation only some properties of the wave equation can be preserved by the model. A spatial discretization by an integration method reduces the nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE can be interpreted as an electrical circuit. A variety of integration methods is available. Regions of validity for the circuit model have to be derived from stability conditions of the associated integration method. Hence the modelling involves physical and mathematical aspects. In this papers several circuit models for both linear and nonlinear lossless wave equations are presented. The quality in the linear case is evaluated by a comparison of network properties like reciprocity, symmetry, losslessness and non-minimum-phase property with the analytic solution.},

abstract={There is an intimate relation between certain autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems and numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues. One of these systems is the Toda lattice, a one-dimensional mechanical model consisting of mass points connected by springs with exponential characteristics. The equilibrium of a transformed version of the equations of motion is equal to the eigen-values of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the entries of which have been used to initialize the dynamical system. Clearly, a nonlinear dynamical electrical network can be modelled on these equations of motion. In this paper several network models are developed, each with individual advantages. For the electrical model matrices with arbitrary sub- and superdiagonal entries are allowed as initial values as opposed to the mechanical one with positive entries only. The losslessness and reciprocity of the electrical Toda lattice can be proved by means of Telegen's Theorem.},

abstract={In the last years, there was growing interest in digital VLSI-implementation of computational intensive tasks, e.g. solution of systems of linear equations, eigenvalue or singular value computation. Iterative eigenvalue and singular value algorithms can be extended to ordinary differential equations and in this way an alternative to digital implementations can be offered. These differential equations and their properties will be presented in this paper. One basic step for finding a VLSI-suited analog circuit realization is to design network models. Several models for diagonalization of symmetric tridiagonal matrices will be proposed. The class of circuits to be discussed here has some remarkable properties such as invariants like losslessness or polynomial type nonlinearity. Therefore, these network models are very encouraging with respect to specialized analog VLSI-architectures capable of computing eigenvalues. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last years completely integrable Hamiltonian systems were of great interest because of their physical nature, e.g. the existence of soliton solutions, and their relation to eigenvalue and sorting problems. But until recently, they fourd little interest among electrical engineers. Under certain restrictions, cellular neural networks (CNN) come very close to some Hamiltonian systems, therefore they are potentially useful for simulating or realizing such systems. In this paper, we wiE show how to map two one-dimensional nonlinear lattices, the Fermi-Pasta- Ulam lattice and the Toda lattice, onto a CNN. We demonstrate for the Toda lattice, what happens, if the signals are driven beyond the linear region of the PWL output function. Though the system is no longer Hamiltonian, numerical experiments reveal the existence of solitons for special initial conditions. This interesting phenomenon is due to a special symmetry in the CNN system of ODE's. © 1992 IEEE.},

abstract={The extrapolation of a discrete-time signal is considered. Iterative algorithms for this problem require numerous iterations for accurate results. An analysis shows the very large condition number of the linear equations, and thus the slow convergence. One way to circumvent the slow convergence is to use better algorithms, such as truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) or special conjugate gradient algorithms. An improved problem formulation is proposed. It is shown how to reduce the condition number by some orders of magnitude with a more realistic low-pass filter matrix. The modified system is solved by TSVD with uncritical dependence of the solution error on the number of singular values involved.},
