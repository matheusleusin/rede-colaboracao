abstract={In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of large-scale human mobility patterns obtained from a passive Wi-Fi tracking system, deployed across different location typologies. We have deployed a system to cover urban areas served by public transportation systems as well as very isolated and rural areas. Over 4 years, we collected 572 million data points from a total of 82 routers covering an area of 2.8 km2. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the data and discuss how our low-cost approach can be used to help communities and policymakers to make decisions to improve people’s mobility at high temporal and spatial resolution by inferring presence characteristics against several sources of ground truth. Also, we present an automatic classification technique that can identify location types based on collected data. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Flags are important national symbols that have transcended into the digital world with inclusion in the Unicode character set. Despite their significance, there is little information about their role in online communication. This article examines the role of flag emoji in political communication online by analyzing 640,676 tweets by the most important political parties and Members of Parliament in Germany and the United States. We find that national flags are frequently used in political communication and are mostly used in-line with political ideology. As off-line, flag emoji usage in online communication is associated with external events of national importance. This association is stronger in the United States than in Germany. The results also reveal that the presence of the national flag emoji is associated with significantly higher engagement in Germany irrespective of party, whereas it is associated with slightly higher engagement for politicians of the Republican party and slightly lower engagement for Democrats in the United States. Implications of the results and future research directions are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Millions of people use mobile map applications like Google Maps on a regular basis. However, despite these applications' ubiquity, the literature contains very little information about how these applications are used in the real world. As such, many researchers and practitioners seeking to improve mobile map applications may not be able to identify important challenges and may miss major opportunities for innovation. To address this paucity of usage information, we collected and analysed data during unsupervised usage of Google Maps by replacing the standard application with a wrapped version called MapRecorder. In two studies we recorded data from locals and tourists using our application and collected over 580 minutes of actual application usage from 34 users, spanning 555 unique sessions. We identify typical usage scenarios, observe a large amount of map exploration and elucidate generalisable interaction patterns. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this paper, we present OORT, a cooling system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that improves wearing comfort by decreasing skin temperatures of the facial areas covered by the headset. The integrated cooling system consists of an electronically controlled fan blower. The fan compartment is integrated into an hmd padding element with custom-designed air flow channels that provide cool air circulation around the covered facial regions. We report on the design and implementation of OORT as a viable way to provide thermal comfort during long-term virtual reality experiences. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Mobile navigation apps are among the most used mobile applications and are often used as a baseline to evaluate new mobile navigation technologies in field studies. As field studies often introduce external factors that are hard to control for, we investigate how pedestrian navigation methods can be evaluated in virtual reality (VR). We present a study comparing navigation methods in real life (RL) and VR to evaluate if VR environments are a viable alternative to RL environments when it comes to testing these. In a series of studies, participants navigated a real and a virtual environment using a paper map and a navigation app on a smartphone. We measured the differences in navigation performance, task load and spatial knowledge acquisition between RL and VR. From these we formulate guidelines for the improvement of pedestrian navigation systems in VR like improved legibility for small screen devices. We furthermore discuss appropriate low-cost and low-space VR-locomotion techniques and discuss more controllable locomotion techniques. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Targeted environmental and ecosystem management remain crucial in control of dengue. However, providing detailed environmental information on a large scale to effectively target dengue control efforts remains a challenge. An important piece of such information is the extent of the presence of potential dengue vector breeding sites, which consist primarily of open containers such as ceramic jars, buckets, old tires, and flowerpots. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a pipeline to detect outdoor open containers which constitute potential dengue vector breeding sites from geotagged images and to create highly detailed container density maps at unprecedented scale. We implement the approach using Google Street View images which have the advantage of broad coverage and of often being two to three years old which allows correlation analyses of container counts against historical data from manual surveys. Containers comprising eight of the most common breeding sites are detected in the images using convolutional neural network transfer learning. Over a test set of images the object recognition algorithm has an accuracy of 0.91 in terms of F-score. Container density counts are generated and displayed on a decision support dashboard. Analyses of the approach are carried out over three provinces in Thailand. The container counts obtained agree well with container counts from available manual surveys. Multi-variate linear regression relating densities of the eight container types to larval survey data shows good prediction of larval index values with an R-squared of 0.674. To delineate conditions under which the container density counts are indicative of larval counts, a number of factors affecting correlation with larval survey data are analyzed. We conclude that creation of container density maps from geotagged images is a promising approach to providing detailed risk maps at large scale. © 2019 Haddawy et al.},

abstract={This paper explores ‘A to B’ routing tools designed to chart accessible routes for wheelchair users. We develop and present a novel measurement framework based upon cost-benefit analysis in order to evaluate the real-world utility of routing systems for wheelchair users. Using this framework, we compare proposed routes generated by accessibility tools with the pedestrian routes generated by Google Maps by means of conducting expert assessments of the situation on the ground. Relative to tools aimed at pedestrians, we find that these tools are not significantly more likely to produce an accessible route, and more often than not, they present longer routes that arise from imaginary barriers that do not exist in the real world. This analysis indicates how future routing tools for wheelchair users should be designed to ensure that they genuinely ameliorate the effects of accessibility barriers in the built environment. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Mobile health applications can increase access to healthcare in low and middle-income countries, where the penetration of smartphones is rapidly increasing. However, despite a large amount of clinical trials of mobile health applications, there is little proof of beneficial clinical outcomes. Recent studies suggest that one of the reasons is user experience issues. The aim of our work is to improve the user experience of acquiring medical eye images with a smartphone camera. We present EyeGuide, a mobile application that assists people in taking eye images. Possible application areas are the algorithmic detection of diseases and the support of clinicians during tele-medicine examinations. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We present a novel forearm-and-glove tactile interface that can enhance 3D interaction by guiding hand motor planning and coordination. In particular, we aim to improve hand motion and pose actions related to selection and manipulation tasks. Through our user studies, we illustrate how tactile patterns can guide the user, by triggering hand pose and motion changes, for example to grasp (select) and manipulate (move) an object. We discuss the potential and limitations of the interface, and outline future work. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Everyday mobility encompasses different forms of public and private transportation. However, everyday mobility often does not involve substantial levels of physical activity. The goal of this workshop is to investigate ways of integrating physical activity into everyday mobility in accordance with widely accepted health recommendations. We aim to explore wearable and ambient systems that sense and support active navigation as well as conceptual aspects from a variety of perspectives, such as persuasive technologies. Researchers from different disciplines are invited to contribute their point of view by means of position papers, posters, and demonstrations. One planned outcome of this workshop is a set of design guidelines for navigation systems that explicitly consider health aspects. The workshop explores requirements and design challenges in a creative setting. © Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Smartwatches are highly portable, ubiquitous devices, allowing rich interaction at a small scale. However, the display size can hinder user engagement, limit information display, and presentation style. Most research focuses on exploring ways in which the interaction area of smartwatches can be extended, although this mainly entails simple fold-out displays or additional screens. Conversely, added weight and size can hinder the wearable experience. In response, we took inspiration from origami and explored the design space for new types of lightweight, highly foldable smartwatch, by developing complex paper-prototypes which demonstrate novel ways of extending screen space. We collected data on potential input and output interaction with complex folded smartwatch displays during workshops with expert and non-expert users, discovering application ideas and additional input/output functionality. These insights were used to produce and evaluate a concept video for the FoldWatch prototype. Copyright © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, the growth of the travel industry has been astounding. Yet, it is still not easy for an individual to have a meaningful travel experience even, so vast amounts of information are available on the web. As an attempt to support travel decisionmaking and improve visitor's experience, we designed Where2. Where2 is a location-based mobile app that highlights Points of Interest (POI) customized to tourist's travel- related attributes (e.g. the length of their stay). POIs are in-situ recommendations proposed as "Ghost Paths" journeys - the idea that you can follow a prior tourist shoes to explore the city. We generate "Ghost Paths" journeys by using a non-intrusive positioning system that captures prior tourists' Wi-Fi signal and detect their journeys across the city. With this system our goal is to support visitors with their travel decisions and nudge them towards optimal journey choices that maximize their utilities. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Platforms like Google Maps or Bing Maps are used by a large number of users to find the shortest path to their destinations. While these services mainly focus on supporting drivers and pedestrians, first services exist that support wheelchair users. Routing algorithms for wheelchair users try to avoid obstacles like stairs or bollards and optimize on criteria like surface properties and slope of the route. In this study, we undertake the first controlled examination of wheelchair routing approaches. By analyzing three routing platforms, including two wheelchair routing algorithms and three pedestrian routing algorithms, across fifteen major cities in Germany, our results highlight that the routes for wheelchair users are significantly longer and partially also more complex than those for pedestrians. In addition, we show that today's pedestrian routing algorithms also output very diverse routes. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={Being in nature is often regarded to be calming, relaxing and purifying. While technology has the potential to support engagement with nature, developing systems that provide support in an unobtrusive manner holds many challenges for interaction design. In this article, the authors describe their reflections around the NatureCHI workshop series. The aim with the workshops has been to help foster a research community interested in the design of Unobtrusive User Experiences with Technology in Nature. The first of two workshops ran as part of CHI 2016 in San Jose, California, while the second workshop took place alongside MobileHCI 2017 in Vienna, Austria. With 25 papers presented in total, the workshops demonstrate a rising interest in the areas where nature and interactive technologies meet. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={As humans, we have the natural capability of localizing the origin of sounds. Spatial audio rendering leverages this skill by applying special filters to recorded audio to create the impression that a sound emanates from a certain position in the physical space. A main application for spatial audio on mobile devices is to provide non-visual navigation cues. Current systems require users to either listen to artificial beacon sounds, or the entire audio source (e.g., a song) is re-positioned in space, which impacts the listening experience. We present NavigaTone, a system that takes advantage of multi-track recordings and provides directional cues by moving a single track in the auditory space. While minimizing the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience, a user study showed that participants could localize sources as good as with stereo panning while the listening experience was rated to be closer to common music listening. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Many applications of geotagged content are predicated on the concept of localness (e.g., local restaurant recommendation, mining social media for local perspectives on an issue). However, definitions of who is a "local" in a given area are typically informal and ad-hoc and, as a result, approaches for localness assessment that have been used in the past have not been formally validated. In this paper, we begin the process of addressing these gaps in the literature. Specifically, we (1) formalize definitions of "local" using themes identified in a 30-paper literature review, (2) develop the first ground truth localness dataset consisting of 132 Twitter users and 58,945 place-tagged tweets, and (3) use this dataset to evaluate existing localness assessment approaches. Our results provide important methodological guidance to the large body of research and practice that depends on the concept of localness and suggest means by which localness assessment can be improved. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper investigates bias in coverage between Western and Arab media on Twitter after the November 2015 Beirut and Paris terror attacks. Using two Twitter datasets covering each attack, we investigate how Western and Arab media differed in coverage bias, sympathy bias, and resulting information propagation. We crowdsourced sympathy and sentiment labels for 2,390 tweets across four languages (English, Arabic, French, German), built a regression model to characterize sympathy, and thereafter trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict sympathy. Key findings show: (a) both events were disproportionately covered (b) Western media exhibited less sympathy, where each media coverage was more sympathetic towards the country affected in their respective region (c) Sympathy predictions supported ground truth analysis that Western media was less sympathetic than Arab media (d) Sympathetic tweets do not spread any further. We discuss our results in light of global news flow, Twitter affordances, and public perception impact. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Digital maps represent an incredible HCI success-they have transformed the way people navigate in and access information about the world. While these platforms contain terabytes of data about road networks and points of interest (POIs), their information about physical accessibility is commensurately poor. Moreover, because of their highly graphical nature and reliance on gesture and mouse input, digital maps can be inaccessible to some user groups (e.g., those with visual or motor impairments). While there is active HCI work towards addressing both concerns, to our knowledge, there has been no direct effort to unite this research community. The goal of this SIG is threefold: first, to bring together and network scholars and practitioners who are broadly working in the area of accessible maps; second, to identify grand challenges and open problems; third, to help better establish accessible maps as a valuable topic with important HCI-related research problems. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Choosing a seat for traveling can be a complex evaluation of constraints depending on personal preferences. There are websites that help to choose the best seat in a bus, in a train, or on an airplane. However, these recommendations only consider seat-related factors and not the view from the window. While a scenic view rarely influences the decision for a seat on a plane, it is much more important for train rides and especially for scenic bus tours. Therefore, travel website users often discuss which side offers the best view on a specific trip. We propose an algorithm, which decides on which side of the road the view is the most scenic based on Google Street View images. These results can be used by travelers to choose a seat and by scenic tour providers to balance the scenic views between sides or add options during checkout. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={While popular digital maps support an unprecedented number of use cases, new reference map customization tools have been created for purposes for which those maps fall short. With the goal of informing the design of this new class of cartographic tools, we present the first study of naturalistic (“bespoke”) map customization behavior. Through a mixed methods and mixed-media approach involving a survey, the analysis of a corpus of customized maps, and an interview with a power user, we find that bespoke map customization is a relatively common activity and identify frequent use cases as well as map customization strategies. We discuss these use cases and strategies in detail, and propose design implications for future customization tools, such as the use of templates for common use cases, adaptability for various customization styles and the support of multimedia interaction. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Many virtual and mixed reality games focus on single player experiences. In this paper, we describe the concept and prototype implementation of a mixed reality multiplayer game that can be played with a smartphone and an HMD in outdoor environments. Players can team up to fight against attacking alien drones. The relative positions between the players are tracked using GPS, and the rear camera of the smartphone is used to augment the environment and teammates with virtual objects. The combination of multiplayer, mixed reality, the use of geographical location and outdoor action together with affordable, mobile equipment enables a novel strategic and social game experience. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This study focuses on innovative ways to digitally instrument the servicescape in bricks-and-mortar retailing. In the present digital era, technological developments allow for augmenting the shopping experience and capturing moments-of-truth along the shopper's path-to-purchase. This article provides an encompassing inventory of retail technologies resulting from a systematic screening of three secondary data sources, over 2008–2016: (1) the academic marketing literature, (2) retailing related scientific ICT publications, and (3) business practices (e.g., publications from retail labs and R&D departments). An affinity diagram approach allows for clustering the retail technologies from an HCI perspective. Additionally, a categorization of the technologies takes place in terms of the type of shopping value that they offer, and the stage in the path-to-purchase they prevail. This in-depth analysis results in a comprehensive inventory of retail technologies that allows for verifying the suitability of these technologies for targeted in-store shopper marketing objectives (cf. the resulting online faceted-search repository at www.retail-tech.org). The findings indicate that the majority of the inventoried technologies provide cost savings, convenience and utilitarian value, whereas few offer hedonic or symbolic benefits. Moreover, at present the earlier stages of the path-to-purchase appear to be the most instrumented. The article concludes with a research agenda. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={360° videos are a new kind of medium that gives the viewers a sense of real immersion as they glimpse the action from all angles and directions. Naturally, professional and amateur film-makers are actively adopting this new medium for transformative storytelling. Despite this phenomenal progress in 360° video creation, current understanding on users' viewing experience of these videos is limited. In this paper, we present the first comparative study on the user experience with 360° videos on mobile devices using different interaction techniques. We observed 18 participants' interaction with six 360° videos with different viewport characteristics (static or moving) on a smartphone, a tablet and a head mounted display (HMD) respectively and measured how they interact with the content. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the participants in which they explained their interaction with and viewing experience of 360° videos across three devices. Our findings show that 360° videos with moving viewports elicit higher engagement from the viewers, and offer superior viewing experience. However, these videos are cognitively demanding and require constant user attention. Our participants preferred the condition with dynamic peephole interaction on a smartphone for watching 360° videos due to the simplicity in exploration and familiarity with navigation controls. Many participants reported that the HMD offers the most immersive experience however it comes at the expense of higher cognitive burden, motion sickness and physical discomfort. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Many destinations' economies strongly rely on tourism. Therefore, it is crucial to meet tourists' expectations, so they will return to the destination. The geographical formation of certain touristic islands often leads to local climates where it can be rainy and windy on one side of the island, whereas the other part is sunny. In this paper, we present a novel use for a network of sensors, LightBeam, a mobile location-based application aiming to improve the tourists' experience. The application focuses on providing real-time guidance for tourists seeking sunlight to maximize their holiday experience by suggesting the closest points of interest (POIs) to the user with the "best sunlight". To achieve this, we implemented and installed a network of geospatial sensors. The data from the sensor network is combined with the current location of the users to provide recommendations. We report on the initial design and prototype of LightBeam.},

abstract={Landmark-based navigation systems have proven benefits relative to traditional turn-by-turn systems that use street names and distances. However, one obstacle to the implementation of landmark-based navigation systems is the complex challenge of selecting salient local landmarks at each decision point for each user. In this paper, we present Pharos, a novel system that extends turn-by-turn navigation instructions using a single global landmark (e.g. the Eiffel Tower, the Burj Khalifa, municipal TV towers) rather than multiple, hard-to-select local landmarks. We first show that our approach is feasible in a large number of cities around the world through the use of computer vision to select global landmarks. We then present the results of a study demonstrating that by including global landmarks in navigation instructions, users navigate more confidently and build a more accurate mental map of the navigated area than using turn-by-turn instructions.},

abstract={Being in nature is typically regarded to be calming, relaxing and purifying. When in nature, people often seek to be mobile through physical activity such as hiking. But also, nature provides an opportunity for meditative, mindful or inspiring experiences remote from urban everyday life. Mobile Technologies such as sports tracking technologies, electronic tourist guides, mobile phone integrated cameras and omnipresent social media access, have potential to both enhance and disrupt a user's interaction with and experience of nature. This MobileHCI workshop follows on from the first successful NatureCHI workshop by focusing on the challenges associated with the design of mobile technologies that support unobtrusive interaction in nature.},

abstract={Adaptive map interfaces have the potential of increasing usability by providing more task dependent and personalized support. It is unclear, however, how map adaptation must be designed to avoid a loss of control, transparency, and predictability. This article investigates the user experience of adaptive map interfaces in the context of gaze-based activity recognition. In a Wizard of Oz experiment we study two adaptive map interfaces differing in the degree of controllability and compare them to a non-adaptive map interface. Adaptive interfaces were found to cause higher user experience and lower perceived cognitive workload than the non-adaptive interface. Among the adaptive interfaces, users clearly preferred the condition with higher controllability. Results from structured interviews reveal that participants dislike being interrupted in their spatial cognitive processes by a sudden adaptation of the map content. Our results suggest that adaptive map interfaces should provide their users with control at what time an adaptation will be performed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Catastrophic incidents associated with GPS devices and other personal navigation technologies are sufficiently common that these incidents have been given a colloquial nickname: "Death by GPS". While there is a significant body of work on the use of personal navigation technologies in everyday scenarios, no research has examined these technologies' roles in catastrophic incidents. In this paper, we seek to address this gap in the literature. Borrowing techniques from public health research and communication studies, we construct a corpus of 158 detailed news reports of unique catastrophic incidents associated with personal navigation technologies. We then identify key themes in these incidents and the roles that navigation technologies played in them, e.g. missing road characteristics data contributed to over 24% of these incidents. With the goal of reducing casualties associated with personal navigation technologies, we outline implications for design and research that emerge from our results, e.g. advancing "space usage rule" mapping, incorporating weather information in routing, and improving visual and audio instructions in complex situations.

abstract={Much research has shown that social media platforms have substantial population biases. However, very little is known about how these population biases affect the many algorithms that rely on social media data. Focusing on the case study of geolocation inference algorithms and their performance across the urban-rural spectrum, we establish that these algorithms exhibit significantly worse performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural users). We further establish that this finding is robust across both text- and network-based algorithm designs. However, we also show that some of this bias can be attributed to the design of algorithms themselves rather than population biases in the underlying data sources. For instance, in some cases, algorithms perform badly for rural users even when we substantially overcorrect for population biases by training exclusively on rural data. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design and study of social media-based algorithms. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={We introduce WatchThru, an interactive method for extended wrist-worn display on commercially-available smartwatches. To address the limited visual and interaction space, WatchThru expands the device into 3D through a transparent display. This enables novel interactions that leverage and extend smartwatch glanceability. We describe three novel interaction techniques, Pop-up Visuals, Second Perspective and Peek-through, and discuss how they can complement interaction on current devices. We also describe two types of prototypes that helped us to explore standalone interactions, as well as, proof-of-concept AR interfaces using our platform.

abstract={The financial crisis and austerity politics in Europe has had a devastating impact on public services, social security and vulnerable populations. Greek civil society responded quickly by establishing solidarity structures aimed at helping vulnerable citizens to meet their basic needs and empower them to co-create an anti-austerity movement. While digital technology and social media played an important role in the initiation of the movement, it has a negligible role in the movement's on-going practices. Through embedded work with several solidarity structures in Greece, we have begun to understand the 'solidarity economy' (SE) as an experiment in direct democracy and self-organization. Working with a range of solidarity structures we are developing a vision for a 'Solidarity HCI' committed to designing to support personal, social and institutional transformation through processes of agonistic pluralism and contestation, where the aims and objectives of the SE are continuously re-formulated and put into practice. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The widespread popularity of Pokémon GO presents the first opportunity to observe the geographic effects of location-based gaming at scale. This paper reports the results of a mixed methods study of the geography of Pokémon GO that includes a five-country field survey of 375 Pokémon GO players and a large scale geostatistical analysis of game elements. Focusing on the key geographic themes of places and movement, we find that the design of Pokémon GO reinforces existing geographically-linked biases (e.g. the game advantages urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations), that Pokémon GO may have instigated a relatively rare large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns, and that Pokémon GO has geographically-linked safety risks, but not those typically emphasized by the media. Our results point to geographic design implications for future systems in this space such as a means through which the geographic biases present in Pokémon GO may be counteracted.

abstract={Location information that is crucial for all location-based services is almost always available due to a number of different positioning techniques and technologies such as GPS and WiFi positioning. However, positioning technologies cannot provide sufficient position information when a user is underground, e.g. travelling with a car through a tunnel or on subways on an underground public transportation network. While there have been a number of attempts to utilize expensive infrastructure and smartphone sensors to address this situation, all of these techniques are either limited in scope, very expensive, or somewhat limited in accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel smartphone-based approach called SubwayAPPS (Subway Air Pressure Positioning System) that for the first time utilizes relative air pressure changes as detected by smartphone barometers to position a user. We first demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by comparing the depth characteristics of five major underground transportation networks across the globe and show that our novel approach is feasible for positioning users while they are underground in these networks. Second, we showwith two user tests in Brussels and London that our lightweight approach works well as other more complex techniques, e.g. techniques that rely on pattern matching using the build-in accelerometers or gyroscopes, under realistic conditions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Humans perceive different objects, scenes or places using all their senses. Our sensory richness also plays an important role for creative activities. Humans also recall those sensory experiences in order to spark creativity, e.g. while writing a text. This paper presents a study with 100 students, divided in groups, that explores the effect of auditory and olfactory cues and their combination during a creative writing exercise. Our results provide useful insights suggesting that olfactory cues have an important role in the creative process of users and even when this type of cues are combined with auditory cues. We believe, that this type of modalities should gain more relevance on the development of creativity support tools and environments for supporting the creative writing process. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The current information marketplace for tourists is dominated by for-profit purveyors of information. Potential visitors must rely on experts-for-hire or search engine results in order to learn about a desired destination. In this paper, we introduce The Madeira Touch, a multimodal display installation rooted in the unique characteristics of Madeira, which allows users to explore the island by selecting a type of scenery and showing the user-generated photos of that type of scenery in a map-based interface. To make this pervasive display more engaging, we designed an exploratory tactile-input mode of interaction: users will be able to touch a physical object, representing a type of scenery (a rock for mountains, a seashell for the sea, etc.), which will then bring up suitable photos of that type of scenery overlaid on a map of the island. The display will help users to form their mental image of the island and to plan trips that best suit their interests. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={In daily life, we use computers and smartphones to organize a groups activities and share documents with its members. However, creating that group in the digital domain is often performed manually. Solutions to automate the process of forming a group of physically proximate members, so far, mostly relied on Bluetooth or WiFi. In contrast to these solutions we present Grouve, an automatic ad-hoc based group formation technique running based on ultrasonic waves. As Grouve uses inaudible sounds for communication, it has the natural advantage that the sound signal stays inside a limited space, which matches most of the application contexts. In this paper we report on the design process and implementation of Grouve. Copyright © 2016 EAI},

Whilst much research exists on the technical issues and interaction techniques related to such AR displays, currently there has been little research on how these applications are actually used. In this paper, we present the first study reporting on usage comfort and spatial aspects when using an AR browsing app on to browse augmented content on a physical poster. Key findings are that the mean distance users preferred to stand from the poster content was 129 cm (SD = 34 cm) and that standing further from the poster enabled a browsing task to be completed more quickly. Based on our findings we make recommendations on the content and spatial location of AR poster installations.},

abstract={Most outdoor activities and outdoor sports include a navigation component. For example, hiking, biking, mountaineering and climbing activities require orientation and wayfinding at certain points to certain degrees. With the rise of personal GPS devices, numerous navigation apps now exist that are tailored to the specific needs of outdoor enthusiasts. Nevertheless, they all have the common problem, that they require the users to "store" the mobile device in their pockets to have the "hands free" for interaction. While wearable devices such as smartwatches overcome this problem, they have the disadvantage that they often offer very small screen space. In this paper we present StrapMaps, a concept to bring interactive e-ink displays to straps of backpacks or harnesses to present map information while on-The-go in nature. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Eco-Maps, diagrammatic assessments of family relationships, are used by social workers in individual and family contact to understand the subjective experiences of both supportive and disruptive family, friendship, and community relationships. In this paper we present the first phase of the development of the People in my Life app. We have developed a tangible version of Eco-Maps to unlock the potential of ecomaps in the digital domain and to enhance social work practice with children and young people. The central idea is to develop an improved, technology-based means to assess relationships that supports and enhances social work practice and foregrounds children and young people's experiences. In particular, the project has three aims: (a) to collaboratively develop with social workers an application for creating ecomaps using touch-screens with tangible objects, (b) to test its usability with children, in the first instance, and (c) to provide a first exploration of the psychometric properties of parameters captured by the app. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Maps are a very powerful form of information visualization. Beside their main purpose to communicate often very complex relationships between elements of some space, "good" maps are often perceived as aesthetically pleasing and beautiful. Maps are collected for those reasons; since centuries and ages they are "beautiful" - over all trends. Cartography, the study and practice of making maps, has long tradition. Even today, most of the maps, e.g., road maps and public you-are-here maps, are still crafted by professional cartographers. However, maps do require space to be displayed while mobile and wearable devices are getting smaller and smaller. This presents new challenges in cartography, as designing aesthetic user interfaces is an important aspect in the area of HCI. With StripeMaps we present a technique to bring maps to very small displays without destroying their utility and beauty. In this workshop paper we discuss our design considerations in depth and open up the discussion for alternative approaches.},

abstract={Mobile devices are currently the most commonly used platform to experience Augmented Reality (AR). Nevertheless, they typically provide a less than ideal ergonomic experience, requiring the user to operate them with arms raised. In this paper we evaluate how to improve the ergonomics of AR experiences by modifying the angle between the mobile device's camera and its display. Whereas current mobile device cameras point out vertically from the back cover, we modify the camera angle to be 0, 45 and 90 degrees. In addition, we also investigate the use of the smartwatch as an AR browser form factor. Key findings are, that whilst the current approximately seethrough configuration provides the fastest task completion times, a camera offset angle of 45° provides reduced task load and was preferred by users. When comparing different form factors and screen sizes, the smartwatch format was found to be unsuitable for AR browsing use. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Providing pedestrian navigation instructions on small screens is a challenging task due to limited screen space. As image-based approaches for navigation have been successfully proven to outperform map-based navigation on mobile devices, we propose to bring image-based navigation to smartwatches. We contribute a straightforward pipeline to easily create image-based indoor navigation instructions that allow users to freely navigate in indoor environments without any localization infrastructure and with minimal user input on the smartwatch. In a user study, we show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the art application in terms of task completion time, perceived task load and perceived usability. In addition, we did not find an indication that there is a need to provide explicit directional instructions for image-based navigation on small screens. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={An increasing share of our daily interactions with others is mediated through mobile communication technologies. People communicate via text, emoticons, emojis and rich media such as video. We explore the design of Heartefacts, short video clips composed of highlights determined by heart rate changes while watching videos. Our survey investigated video sharing behaviour, and our feasibility study examined the possibility of detecting highlights in videos by monitoring people's heart rates measured with off-the-shelf wristworn sensors. Our results show that people do indeed have measurable responses with respect to their heartbeat patterns to six different emotions elicited by video clips. We compare video highlights verbally identified by our participants to physiological highlights as indicated by their heart rate data and also discuss and compare the automatically generated Heartefacts with video highlights created by an expert in video art. We close with design considerations for Heartefacts in mobile technology.},

abstract={Geotagged tweets and other forms of social media volunteered geographic information (VGI) are becoming increasingly critical to many applications and scientific studies. An important assumption underlying much of this research is that social media VGI is "local", or that its geotags correspond closely with the general home locations of its contributors. We demonstrate through a study on three separate social media communities (Twitter, Flickr, Swarm) that this localness assumption holds in only about 75% of cases. In addition, we show that the geographic contours of localness follow important sociodemographic trends, with social media in, for instance, rural areas and older areas, being substantially less local in character (when controlling for other demographics). We demonstrate through a case study that failure to account for non-local social media VGI can lead to misrepresentative results in social media VGI-based studies. Finally, we compare the methods for determining localness, finding substantial disagreement in certain cases, and highlight new best practices for social media VGI-based studies and systems. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of "unmapped" geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. "no dogs", "no smoking", "no fishing", "no skateboarding"). Researchers in the area of humancomputer interaction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated mapping of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems (e.g. one-touch "Can I Smoke Here?" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this paper, we present a novel SUR mapping technique - SPtP - that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the most important components of the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'no smoking' sign) with the corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g. the nearby park or the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paper also contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help further research in this area.},

abstract={Being in nature is typically regarded to be calming, relaxing and purifying. When in nature, people often seek physical activity like hiking, or meditative, mindful or inspiring experiences remote from the urban everyday life. However, the modern lifestyle easily extends technology use to all sectors of our everyday life, and e.g. the rise of sports tracking technologies, mobile phone integrated cameras and omnipresent social media access have contributed to technologies also arriving into the use context of nature. Also maps and tourist guides are increasingly smart phone or tablet based services. This workshop addresses the challenges that are related to interacting with technology in nature. The viewpoints cover, but are not limited to interaction design and prototyping, social and cultural issues, user experiences that aim for unobtrusive interactions with the technology with nature as the use context. © 2016 Authors.},

abstract={Navigation systems allow drivers to find the shortest or fastest path between two or multiple locations mostly using time or distance as input parameters. Various researchers extended traditional route planning approaches by taking into account the user's preferences, such as enjoying a coastal view or alpine landscapes during a drive. Current approaches mainly rely on volunteered geographic information (VGI), such as point of interest (POI) data from OpenStreetMap, or social media data, such as geotagged photos from Flickr, to generate scenic routes. While these approaches use proximity, distribution or other spatial relationships of the data sets, they do not take into account the actual view on specific route segments. In this paper, we propose Autobahn: a system for generating scenic routes using Google Street View images to classify route segments based on their visual characteristics enhancing the driving experience. We show that this vision-based approach can complement other approaches for scenic route planning and introduce a personalized scenic route by aligning the characteristics of the route to the preferences of the user. © Copyright 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Eye tracking is one of the most prominent modalities to track user attention while interacting with computational devices. Today, most of the current eye tracking frameworks focus on tracking the user gaze during website browsing or while performing other tasks and interactions with a digital device. Most frameworks have in common that they do not exploit gaze as an input modality. In this paper we describe the realization of a framework named viGaze. Its main goal is to provide an easy to use framework to exploit the use of eye gaze as an input modality in various contexts. Therefore it provides features to explore explicit and implicit interactions in complex virtual environments by using the eye gaze of a user for various interactions. The viGaze framework is flexible and can be easily extended to incorporate other input modalities typically used in Post-WIMP interfaces such as gesture or foot input. In this paper we describe the key components of our viGaze framework and additionally describe a user study that was conducted to test the framework. The user study took place in a virtual retail environment, which provides a challenging pervasive environment and contains complex interactions that can be supported by gaze. The participants performed two gaze-based interactions with products on virtual shelves and started an interaction cycle between the products and an advertisement monitor placed on the shelf. We demonstrate how gaze can be used in Post-WIMP interfaces to steer the attention of users to certain components of the system. We conclude by discussing the advantages provided through the viGaze framework and highlighting the potentials of gaze-based interaction. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Map applications for smartwatches present new challenges in cartography, a domain in which large display sizes have significant advantages. In this paper, we introduce StripeMaps, a system that adapts the mobile web design technique of linearization for displaying maps on the small screens of smartwatches. Just as web designers simplify multiple column desktop websites into a single column for easier navigation on mobile devices, StripeMaps transforms any two-dimensional route map into a one-dimensional "stripe". Through a user study, we show that this simplification allows StripeMaps to outperform both traditional mobile map interfaces and turn-by-turn directions for pedestrian navigation using smartwatches. In addition to introducing StripeMaps, this paper also has a secondary contribution. It contains the first empirical comparison of different approaches for pedestrian smartwatch navigation and illuminates their pros and cons. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Interactive workspaces combine horizontal and vertical touch surfaces into a single digital workspace. During an exploration of these systems, it was shown that direct interaction on the vertical surface is cumbersome and more inaccurate than on the horizontal one. To overcome these problems, indirect touch systems turn the horizontal touch surface into an input devices that allows manipulation of objects on the vertical display. If the horizontal touch surface also acts as a display, however, it becomes necessary to distinguish which screen is currently in use by providing a switching mode. We investigate the use of gaze tracking to perform these mode switches. In three user studies we compare absolute and relative gaze augmented selection techniques with the traditional direct-touch approach. Our results show that our relative gaze augmented selection technique outperforms the other techniques for simple tapping tasks alternating between horizontal and vertical surfaces, and for dragging on the vertical surface. However, when tasks involve dragging across surfaces, the findings are more complex. We provide a detailed description of the proposed interaction techniques, a statistical analysis of these interaction techniques, and how they can be applied to systems that involve a combination of multiple horizontal and vertical touch surfaces. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Our interactions with the spaces around us are frequently defined by space usage rules (SURs) like "no smoking", "no dogs allowed", and "stay on the trail". These rules are important public health tools and help protect the environment, among other applications. However, despite their importance, no large-scale database of SURs currently exists. This prevents online/mobile maps from presenting these rules to users, as their traditional paper counterparts have been shown to do regularly. The lack of a SUR database also prevents developers from building novel SUR-based applications, e.g. mobile apps that inform users where they can smoke or walk their dog. In this paper, we present an in-development user interface to support the semi-automatic encoding of SURs expressed in natural language in documents such as laws, city ordinances, park rules, and institution FAQ pages. Our system will allow an untrained user to easily enter complex rules into a spatial data format compatible with OpenStreetMap.},

abstract={There is currently a widespread uncertainty regarding the ability of citizens to control privacy online in the face of ubiquitous surveillance. This is a huge and complex societal problem. Despite the multi-faceted nature of the problem, we propose that HCI researchers can still make a positive contribution in this space through the design of technologies that support citizens to engage with issues of surveillance. In this paper we describe the design of a messaging application called Captchat. Captchat enables people to send everyday messages embedded into images, with the added ability to apply visual distortions to the message to resemble an online CAPTCHA. We propose the chief benefit would be that Captchat messages (with potentially "one-time" distortions) can increase the difficulty for algorithms to index private messages and necessitate the involvement of much more costly human labor in the surveillance process. We developed a prototype and conducted a user study; the results suggest that people were likely to create Captchat messages that were difficult to index for an OCR package but still easy to understand by humans, even without explicit instructions to interact 'securely' with the application. While more work is still required to understand the limitations of Captchat, we hope it can open discussion on how HCI researchers can respond to the challenges faced from ubiquitous surveillance.

abstract={Smartwatches can facilitate several tasks that are performed on mobile devices. However, due to their limited size, touch interaction can be cumbersome. Although alternative input modalities such as speech input could be used, these can also introduce other issues regarding privacy or ease of use. Consequently, HCI researchers have been exploring novel input techniques for smartwatches. In this paper, we introduce WatchMe, a smartwatch application that uses the smartwatch camera and image processing techniques to allow for providing input on a drawing canvas composed of everyday objects and surfaces. We rely on a cloud OCR engine to retrieve text from captured images. Combining these characteristics, we illustrate some scenarios in which WatchMe could be used, such as a novel method for two-factor authentication.},

abstract={Nonverbal and unconscious behaviour is an important component of daily human-human interaction. This is especially true in situations such as public speaking, job interviews or information sensitive conversations, where researchers have shown that an increased awareness of one's behaviour can improve the outcome of the interaction. With wearable technology, such as Google Glass, we now have the opportunity to augment social interactions and provide realtime feedback on one's behaviour in an unobtrusive way. In this paper we present Logue, a system that provides realtime feedback on the presenters' openness, body energy and speech rate during public speaking. The system analyses the user's nonverbal behaviour using social signal processing techniques and gives visual feedback on a head-mounted display. We conducted two user studies with a staged and a real presentation scenario which yielded that Logue's feedback was perceived helpful and had a positive impact on the speaker's performance. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The penetration of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) output devices is becoming widespread. S3D screens range in size from large cinema screens, to tabletop displays, TVs in living rooms, and even mobile devices are nowadays equipped with autostereoscopic 3D screens. As a consequence, the requirement for interacting with 3D content is also increasing, with “touch” being one of the dominant input methods. However, the design requirements and best practices for interaction with S3D touch screen user interfaces are only now evolving. To understand the challenges and limitations S3D technology brings to interaction design, and in particular the additional demands they place on the users of such interfaces, we present our research that considers stereoscopic touch screens of different sizes in static and mobile usage contexts. We report on perceptual, cognitive and behavioral aspects revealed by user studies and present interaction design requirements based on the findings. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Non-verbal and unconscious behavior plays an important role for efficient human-to-human communication but are often undervalued when training people to become better communicators. This is particularly true for public speakers who need not only behave according to a social etiquette but do so while generating enthusiasm and interest for dozens if not hundreds of other persons. In this paper we propose the concept of social augmentation using wearable computing with the goal of giving users the ability to continuously monitor their performance as a communicator. To this end we explore interaction modalities and feedback mechanisms which would lend themselves to this task. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Thanks to rapid advances in technologies like GPS and Wi- Fi positioning, smartphone users are able to determine their location almost everywhere they go. This is not true, however, of people who are traveling in underground public transportation networks, one of the few types of high-traffic areas where smartphones do not have access to accurate position information. In this paper, we introduce the problem of underground transport positioning on smartphones and present SubwayPS, an accelerometerbased positioning technique that allows smartphones to determine their location substantially better than baseline approaches, even deep beneath city streets. We highlight several immediate applications of positioning in subway networks in domains ranging from mobile advertising to mobile maps and present MetroNavigator, a proof-ofconcept smartphone and smartwatch app that notifies users of upcoming points-of-interest and alerts them when it is time to get ready to exit the train.

Using an approach rooted in cartographic theory and a unique dataset of 382 publicly-displayed local maps, we identify the "collective wisdom" of hundreds of cartographers with respect to a number of cartographic design decisions. We compare our findings to the approaches taken in popular online and mobile map platforms and develop suggestions for incorporating the collective wisdom of cartographers into these systems. Our suggestions include the adoption of location-aware cartography, in which cartographic approaches are intelligently varied based on the type of location being viewed. We provide mockup designs of online and mobile maps that implement our suggestions and discuss means by which the surprising gap between online and mobile maps and traditional cartography may be bridged.

abstract={In the age of mobile communications and social media, users are connected to interact with other people, and often obliged to be socially active as technology drives to connect us. In this paper, we harness the technology for the opposite use: helping people to avoid company instead of encouraging interaction. We have developed the concept of an asocial hiking application (app), in which users can generate routes that avoid meeting other people. We developed the concept based on user feedback data derived from an online survey (n=157) and two focus groups, and created a tool that generates solitary hiking routes based on OpenStreetMap data and additional information from the web. In addition, to make the application react to dynamic changes in the environment, we developed a mobile application prototype that scans Wi-Fi signals to detect other hikers nearby and warn of their approach. The prototype was tested and evaluated with 8 hikers in-thewild. In addition to the concept design and the functional prototype, we present findings on people's, especially hikers, need for solitude, and introduce user feedback from each stage of the prototype design process as well as design recommendations for an asocial navigation application.

abstract={We present a large-scale quantitative contextual survey of the geocaching community in Germany, one of the world's largest geocaching communities. We investigate the features, attitudes, interests, and motivations that characterise the German geocachers. Two anonymous surveys have been carried out on this issue in the year 2007. We conducted a large-scale qualitative general study based on web questionnaires and a more targeted study, which aimed at a comprehensive amount of revealed geocaches of a certain region. With sample sizes of n=1982 (study 1: general study) and n=310 (study 2: regional study) we provide a representative basis to ground previous qualitative research in this domain. In addition, we investigated the usage of technology in combination with traditional paper-based media by the geocachers. This knowledge can be used to reflect on past and future trends within the geocaching community. © 2014 Daniel Telaar et al.},

abstract={We present the concept of highly deformable mobile devices that can be transformed into various special-purpose controls in order to bring physical controls to mobile devices. Physical controls have the advantage of exploiting people's innate abilities for manipulating physical objects in the real world. We designed and implemented a prototype, called Paddle, to demonstrate our concept. Additionally, we explore the interaction techniques enabled by this concept and conduct an in-depth study to evaluate our transformable physical controls. Our findings show that these physical controls provide several benefits over traditional touch interaction techniques commonly used on mobile devices.},

abstract={During remote video-mediated assistance, instructors often guide workers through problems and instruct them to perform unfamiliar or complex operations. However, the workers' performance might deteriorate due to stress. We argue that informing biofeedback to the instructor, can improve communication and lead to lower stress. This paper presents a thorough investigation on mental workload and stress perceived by twenty participants, paired up in an instructor-worker scenario, performing remote video-mediated tasks. The interface conditions differ in task, facial and biofeedback communication. Two self-report measures are used to assess mental workload and stress. Results show that pairs reported lower mental workload and stress when instructors are using the biofeedback as compared to using interfaces with facial view. Significant correlations were found on task performance with reducing stress (i.e. increased task engagement and decreased worry) for instructors and declining mental workload (i.e. increased performance) for workers. Our findings provide insights to advance video-mediated interfaces for remote collaborative work.},

abstract={In office spaces, knowledge workers interact both with each other and with various analog and digital devices in the office. We think that the office environment opens up an interesting space to utilize smartwatches to support and digitally augment interactions. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a smartwatch application to digitally augment interactions that are commonly performed in an office environment. For example, our application allows one to physically and virtually lock and unlock doors, to acquire room information and to send virtual knocks with an app running on the watch.},

abstract={Empathic communication allows individuals to perceive and understand the feeling and emotion of the person with whom they are interacting. This could be particularly important during remote collaboration (such as remote assistance or distance learning) to enhance the social and emotional understanding of geographically distributed partners. However, supporting awareness in remote collaboration is very challenging especially when the interaction with the remote parties results in less information that can be communicated than in a physical interaction. We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially influence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, video-conference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the benefits to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness. © 2014 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={We describe FoodBoard, an instrumented chopping board that uses optical fibers and embedded camera imaging to identify unpackaged ingredients during food preparation on its surface. By embedding the sensing directly, and robustly, in the surface of a chopping board we also demonstrate how surface contact optical sensing can be used to realize the portability and privacy required of technology used in a setting such as a domestic kitchen. FoodBoard was subjected to a close to real-world evaluation in which 12 users prepared actual meals. FoodBoard compared favourably with existing unpackaged food recognition systems, classifying a larger number of distinct food ingredients (12 incl. meat, fruit, vegetables) with an average accuracy of 82.8%.

abstract={Most (mobile) online map services focus on providing their users the most efficient route to their target location. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the physical and digital urban navigation to improve wayfinding for pedestrians by enhancing their experiences when strolling through a city. With our application “Space Recommender System” we describe a new wayfinding approach by implementing common digital online methods of commenting and recommender systems into the physical world, using voting data from social network services. Initial findings highlight the general importance of the walking experience to the public and suggest that implementing social media based recommendations in route finding algorithms enhance the pleasure of urban strolling. The initial user tests of the system in a real world context together with collected feedback and the observations throughout the design process stimulate the discussions of wider issues and highlight its potential for future novel wayfinding applications.},

abstract={Geography is playing an increasingly important role in areas of HCI ranging from social computing to natural user interfaces. At the same time, research in geography has focused more and more on technology-mediated interaction with spatiotemporal phenomena. Despite the growing popularity of this geographic human-computer interaction (GeoHCI) in both fields, there have been few opportunities for GeoHCI knowledge sharing, knowledge creation or community building in either discipline, let alone between them. The goal of this workshop is thus two-fold. First, we will seek to sum up the state of GeoHCI knowledge and address GeoHCI core issues by inviting prominent researchers in the space to share and discuss the most important high-level findings from their work. Second, through our interdisciplinary organizing committee, we will bring together participants from both fields, with the goal of laying the groundwork for a community that works across intra- and interdisciplinary boundaries.},

abstract={In todays videogames user feedback is often provided through raw statistics and scoreboards. We envision that incorporating empathic feedback matching the player's current mood will improve the overall gaming experience. In this paper we present Bro-cam, a novel system that provides empathic feedback to the player based on their body postures. Different body postures of the players are used as an indicator for their openness. From their level of openness, Bro-cam profiles the players into different personality types ranging from introvert to extrovert. Empathic feedback is then automatically generated and matched to their preferences for certain humoristic feedback statements. We use a depth camera to track the player's body postures and movements during the game and analyze these to provide customized feedback. We conducted a user study involving 32 players to investigate their subjective assessment on the empathic game feedback.

abstract={Intelligent User Interfaces can benefit from having knowledge on the user's emotion. However, current implementations to detect affective states, are often constraining the user's freedom of movement by instrumenting her with sensors. This prevents affective computing from being deployed in naturalistic and ubiquitous computing contexts. In this paper, we present a novel system called mASqUE, which uses a set of association rules to infer someone's affective state from their body postures. This is done without any user instrumentation and using off-the-shelf and non-expensive commodity hardware: a depth camera tracks the body posture of the users and their postures are also used as an indicator of their openness. By combining the posture information with physiological sensors measurements we were able to mine a set of association rules relating postures to affective states. We demonstrate the possibility of inferring affective states from body postures in ubiquitous computing environments and our study also provides insights how this opens up new possibilities for IUI to access the affective states of users from body postures in a nonintrusive way.

abstract={3D output is no longer limited to large screens in cinemas or living rooms. Nowadays more and more mobile devices are equipped with autostereoscopic 3D (S3D) touchscreens. As a consequence interaction with 3D content now also happens whilst users are on the move. In this paper we carried out a user study with 27 participants to assess how mobile interaction, i.e. whilst walking, with mobile S3D devices, differs from interaction with 2D mobile touchscreens. We investigate the difference in touch accuracy between 2D touchscreens and mobile S3D touchscreens and evaluate the minimum touch target size for mobile S3D touchscreens. The contributions of this paper are twofold: Firstly, we found the increase in minimum touch target size caused by walking was larger for a mobile S3D UI than for a 2D UI. Secondly, we present touch target sizes and aspect ratios required for reliable user interaction in each case. Additionally we examined differences in the angle at which users held the mobile S3D device compared to a 2D mobile device. We found that mobile S3D caused users to hold the device at a different angle when walking, compared to the 2D case. This first study of its kind provides valuable information to developers of the next generation of UIs and applications for mobile S3D displays and devices.},

abstract={Interactive surfaces have great potential for co-located collaboration because of their ability to track multiple inputs simultaneously. However, the multi-user experience on these devices could be enriched significantly if touch points could be associated with a particular user. Existing approaches to user identification are intrusive, require users to stay in a fixed position, or suffer from poor accuracy. We present a non-intrusive, high-accuracy technique for mapping touches to their corresponding user in a collaborative environment. By mounting a high-resolution camera above the interactive surface, we are able to identify touches reliably without any extra instrumentation, and users are able to move around the surface at will. Our technique, which leverages the back of users' hands as identifiers, supports walk-up-and-use situations in which multiple people interact on a shared surface. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Exploratory search, in which a user investigates complex concepts, is cumbersome with today's search engines. We present a new exploratory search approach that generates interactive visualizations of query concepts using thematic cartography (e.g. choropleth maps, heat maps). We show how the approach can be applied broadly across both geographic and non-geographic contexts through explicit spatialization, a novel method that leverages any figure or diagram - from a periodic table, to a parliamentary seating chart, to a world map - as a spatial search environment. We enable this capability by introducing explanatory semantic relatedness measures. These measures extend frequently-used semantic relatedness measures to not only estimate the degree of relatedness between two concepts, but also generate human-readable explanations for their estimates by mining Wikipedia's text, hyperlinks, and category structure. We implement our approach in a system called Atlasify, evaluate its key components, and present several use cases. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In this chapter we will discuss the relatively new research area of context-sensitive Displays. The cheap availability of display spaces in combination with sensor technologies which allows to make inferences about the context of the display will enable a multitude of novel applications. However the foundations of these sensor-display systems are not well understood. Therefore we will discuss in this chapter the basic setup and a research methodology which has helped us to systematically approach the problems we faced during the design of several context-sensitive display environments. For this purpose we will present three research systems: the iDisplay-system, a public information system which uses extensively context-filtered information to inform students in University buildings, the MobiDic-system an context-sensitive advertisement management system for digital outdoor signage and our research on the Münster Multitouch Wall, which demonstrates novel ways of interacting with large displays in public environments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Ubiprojection 2010 workshop being held in conjunction with the Pervasive 2010 conference in Helsinki focused on mobile projection issues. The first article by Willis provides a fascinating historical account of contemporary interaction with handheld projectors. The article shows various interaction techniques that have been used with these historic devices, like device movement, projection occlusions, and overlay of multiple projected images. The second paper by Krum, Suma, and Bolas reports a novel interaction technique and mixed reality system that offers a realistic and robust approach for augmenting the environment with projected information. Cauchard and researchers investigate hand- and foot-based interaction techniques to cope with alignment and misalignment between the projection and the phone. The last paper of this special issue by Bongers reports on an artistic performance using mobile projectors and thus widens the perspective of personal projection.},

abstract={Shopping is one of the most frequently occuring tasks in our daily lives, and creation and management of shopping lists is an important aspect of this task. Given the recent adoption of mobile devices, the process of writing lists is not only limited to the use of pen and paper, as a good number of digital tools and applications are available. The goal of this paper is to study and understand the transition between paper-based and digital shopping lists. We analyze how people interact with paper-based shopping lists and derive design implications for our own hybrid shopping support application, which combines paper-based lists with a mobile application. We contribute the study and the design and implementation of a hybrid (pen-and-paper-based UI and mobile GUI) application for the creation of shopping lists. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={While applications for mobile devices have become extremely important in the last few years, little public information exists on mobile application usage behavior. We describe a large-scale deployment-based research study that logged detailed application usage information from over 4,100 users of Android-powered mobile devices. We present two types of results from analyzing this data: basic descriptive statistics and contextual descriptive statistics. In the case of the former, we find that the average session with an application lasts less than a minute, even though users spend almost an hour a day using their phones. Our contextual findings include those related to time of day and location. For instance, we show that news applications are most popular in the morning and games are at night, but communication applications dominate through most of the day. We also find that despite the variety of apps available, communication applications are almost always the first used upon a device's waking from sleep. In addition, we discuss the notion of a virtual application sensor, which we used to collect the data. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={There are a number of mobile shopping aids and recommender systems available, but none can be easily used for a weekly shop at a local supermarket. We present a minimal, mobile and fully functional lambent display that clips onto any shopping trolley handle, intended to nudge people when choosing what to buy. It provides salient information about the food miles for various scanned food items represented by varying lengths of lit LEDs on the handle and a changing emoticon comparing the average miles of all the products in the trolley against a social norm. When evaluated in situ, the lambent handle display nudged people to choose products with fewer food miles than the items they selected using their ordinary shopping strategies. People also felt guilty when the average mileage of the contents of their entire shopping trolley was above the social norm. The findings are discussed in terms of how to provide different kinds of product information that people care about, using simple lambent displays. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The increasing number of media facades in urban spaces offers great potential for new forms of interaction - especially for collaborative multi-user scenarios. In this paper, we present a way to directly interact with them through live video on mobile devices. We extend the Touch Projector interface to accommodate multiple users by showing individual content on the mobile display that would otherwise clutter the facade's canvas or distract other users. To demonstrate our concept, we built two collaborative multi-user applications: (1) painting on the facade and (2) solving a 15-puzzle. We gathered informal feedback during the ARS Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria and found that our interaction technique is (1) considered easy-to-learn, but (2) may leave users unaware of the actions of others.

abstract={Cars offer an increasing number of infotainment systems as well as comfort functions that can be controlled by the driver. In our research, we investigate new interaction techniques that aim to make it easier to interact with these systems while driving. We suggest utilizing the steering wheel as an additional interaction surface. In this paper, we present two user studies conducted with a working prototype of a multi-touch steering wheel. In the first, we developed a user-defined steering wheel gesture set, and in the second, we applied the identified gestures and compared their application to conventional user interaction with infotainment systems in terms of driver distraction. The main outcome was that driver's visual demand is reduced significantly by using gestural interaction on the multi-touch steering wheel. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Researchers and practitioners in human-computer interaction are increasingly taking geographic approaches to their work. Whether designing novel location-based systems, developing natural user interfaces for maps, or exploring online interactions over space and time, HCI is discovering that geographic questions, methods, and use cases are becoming integral to our field. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there have been no direct efforts to unite members of the community exploring geographic HCI. The goal of this forum is to bring together researchers from a variety of areas to provide a summary of what has been done thus far and to discuss options for developing a more formal geographic HCI community. We will also highlight the troublesome lack of communication between scholars in geography and HCI and the opportunities that will result from increased collaboration between the two fields.},

abstract={Given the growth of Child Computer Interaction research and of the rapid adoption of interactive technologies as teaching tools, next generation HCI technologies play an important role in the future of education. Educators rely on technology to improve/adapt learning to the pedagogical needs of learners, thus the HCI community needs to examine how these concepts can be matched to contemporary paradigms in Educational pedagogy. The classroom is a challenging environment for evaluation, thus new interaction techniques need to be established to prove the value of new HCI interactions in the educational space. This workshop provides a forum to discuss key HCI issues facing next generation education ranging from whole class interactive whiteboards, small group interactive multi-touch tables, and individual personal response systems in the classroom and fits into the CHI 2011 featured community Child Computer Interaction.},

abstract={The electronic market has rapidly grown in the last few years. However, despite this success, consumers still enjoy visiting a "real store with real products". Therefore various common technologies have been installed in supermarkets to support the customer's shopping process and experience. In this paper, we introduce the IRL SmartCart - an instrumented shopping cart that acts as a user interface to support the shopping process. We show how RFID technology enables recognizing products that are put in the cart's basket. We are also able to determine the cart's position in an instrumented shopping environment. User input and visual output are possible by means of a touch screen, which is fitted in the IRL Smart-Cart's handle to support different tasks involved in the shopping process. We present and discuss different location- and context-based services that run on the cart interface system, e.g. a personalized shopping list sorted corresponding to the products in the user's vicinity or a navigation service to different products that the customer is searching for. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Navigation in larger unfamiliar buildings like town halls, airports, shopping malls or other public indoor locations is often difficult for humans. Due to the high amount of infrastructure needed for indoor positioning, just a few navigation services for indoor environments exist. Therefore in many of these buildings 'YOU-ARE-HERE' (YAH) maps are provided, often located at the entrance or other key places, to facilitate orientation and navigation within the building, but they have the disadvantages of being stationary. In this paper, we try to overcome these problems by presenting PINwI (Pedestrian Indoor Navigation without Infrastructure), an application that allows the user of a mobile camera device with integrated compass and accelerometer to utilize a photo of such an indoor YAH-map to navigate through the corresponding building. Using a dead reckoning approach, we enrich stationary analog YAH-maps with basic location functionality and turn them into a digital and dynamic medium that can help decision making while taking turns or estimating distances. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The Third International Workshop on Location and the Web (LocWeb 2010) focuses on research and development that targets the intersection of Internet-enabled location-aware and/or located devices, and services based on Web technologies and Web architecture. The rapid rise of multi-sensory mobile devices and Internet-enabled "things" equipped with sensors and ubiquitous connectivity opens new possibilities and provides the foundations to capture, share and use Web services and applications in ways which go beyond the traditional scenarios of stationary or even mobile computer-like devices. Increasingly, applications will have to bridge the physical world and the Web space, and location is one of the major connecting links. When Web services will "surround" users, designers have to address the challenges of scalability and interoperability on the Web, and designers also have to look at policy, regulatory, and legislative responses to the privacy and security challenges created by something as sensitive as location information.

abstract={In the idea of the Sensor Web, sensors should be discoverable, accessible and taskable over the internet. In this paper, we present a mobile data collection framework for connecting wireless sensors with the Sensor Web by using mobile devices. The proposed system is an extension to Locawe platform including now mapping and WSN features together with features of SWE especially Sensor Observation Service (SOS) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Therefore, the Locawe platform running on mobile devices is used to connect to 6LoWPAN sensors, store the measurements of the sensors on the device's memory, convert it into sensor web protocols and insert the measurements into a sensor service as soon as wireless internet connection is available. As a proof of concept, the system is used within an air quality monitoring scenario. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Touch-sensitive screens enable natural interaction without any instrumentation and support tangible feedback on the touch surface. In particular multi-touch interaction has proven its usability for 2D tasks, but the challenges to exploit these technologies in virtual reality (VR) setups have rarely been studied. In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user's ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our results show that the detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected. © The Eurographics Association 2010.},

abstract={Given the exponential growth of interactive whiteboards in classrooms around the world, and the recent emergence of multi-touch tables, tangible computing devices and mobile devices, there has been a need to explore how next generation HCI will impact education in the future. Educators are depending on the interaction communities to deliver technologies that will improve/adapt learning to an ever-changing world. In addition to novel UI concepts, the HCI community needs to examine how these concepts can be matched to contemporary paradigms in Educational pedagogy. The classroom is a challenging environment for evaluation, thus new interaction techniques need to be established to prove the value of new HCI interactions in the educational space. This workshop provides a forum to discuss key HCI issues facing next generation education ranging from whole class interactive whiteboards, small group interactive multi-touch tables, and individual personal response systems in the classroom. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Cars offer an increasing number of infotainment systems as well as comfort functions that can be controlled by the driver. With our research we investigate new interaction techniques that aim to make it easier to interact with these systems while driving. In contrast to the standard approach of combining all functions into hierarchical menus controlled by a multifunctional controller or a touch screen we suggest to utilize the space on the steering wheel as additional interaction surface. In this paper we show the design challenges that arise for multi-touch interaction on a steering wheel. In particular we investigate how to deal with input and output while driving and hence rotating the wheel. We describe the details of a functional prototype of a multi-touch steering wheel that is based on FTIR and a projector, which was built to explore experimentally the user experience created. In an initial study with 12 participants we show that the approach has a general utility and that people can use gestures for controlling applications intuitively but have difficulties to imagine gestures to select applications. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Many companies are using the web to enable customers to individually customize their products that range from automobiles and bicycles to CDs, cosmetics and shirts. In this paper we present a mobile application for product customization and production within a smart factory. This allows the ad hoc configuration of products at the point of sale (POS). We investigate human factors when customizing products while interacting with them. We focus on the concept of the mobile client that enables this ad hoc modification, but also present the production chain behind our product. We believe that this particular 3D interaction with a product and a mobile device help to improve the customer satisfaction as it allows for customizing a product in an easy and intuitive way. From a CHI perspective an important aspect is that our mobile augmented reality interface can help to match the costumer's expectations with the final modified product and allows the most natural and intuitive interaction. As a use case of the system, we present the modification of a soap dispenser. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={With the miniaturization ofprojection technology, the integration of tiny projection units into mobile devices is no longer fiction: therefore, such integrated projectors in mobile devices could make mobile projection ubiquitous. These phones will have the ability to project large-scale information onto any surfaces in the real world, and by doing so, the interaction space of the mobile device can be considerably expanded. In addition, physical objects in the environment can be augmented with additional information, which can support interaction concepts that are not even possible on modem desktop computers today. The authors believe that mobile cam era-projector units can form a promising interface type for mobile Augmented Reality (AR) applications, thus, this paper identifies different application classes of such interfaces. In addition, different spatial setups of camera and projector units will have an effect on the possible applications and the interaction space with the focus on the augmentation of rval word objects in the environment. This paper presents two examples of applications for mobile camera-projector units and different hardware prototypes that allow augmentation of real world objects. Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.

abstract={In many mid- to large-sized cities public maps are ubiquitous. One can also find a great number of maps in parks or near hiking trails. Public maps help to facilitate orientation and provide special information to not only tourists but also to locals who just want to look up an unfamiliar place while on the go. These maps offer many advantages compared to mobile maps from services like Google Maps Mobile or Nokia Maps. They often show local landmarks and sights that are not shown on standard digital maps. Often these 'YOU ARE HERE' (YAH) maps are adapted to a special use case, e.g. a zoo map or a hiking map of a certain area. Being designed for a fashioned purpose these maps are often aesthetically well designed and their usage is therefore more pleasant. in this paper we present a novel technique and application called PHOTOMAP that uses images of 'YOU ARE HERE' maps taken with a GPS-enhanced mobile camera phone as background maps for on-the-fly navigation tasks. We discuss different implementations of the main challenge, namely helping the user to properly georeference the taken image with sufficient accuracy to support pedestrian navigation tasks. We present a study that discusses the suitability of various public maps for this task and we evaluate if these georeferenced photos can be used for navigation on GPS-enabled devices.},

abstract={We conducted a user study to investigate the effect of visual context in handheld augmented reality interfaces. A dynamic peephole interface (without visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The task was to explore objects on a map and look for a specific attribute shown on the display. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. We found that visual context is most effective for sparse item distributions and the performance benefit decreases with increasing density. User performance in the magic lens case approaches the performance of the dynamic peephole case the more densely spaced the items are. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and dynamic peephole interfaces by suggesting when external visual context is most beneficial.},

abstract={Classic paper-based maps provide high-resolution, large-scale information and are ubiquitous in larger cities and even outdoors. In this paper we present a combination of their advantages with a mobile camera projector unit to create a new mobile and intuitive buddy finder interface. Current friend or buddy finder systems on mobile phones such as Google Latitude suffer from the small screen estate and display size of mobile devices. To overcome this problem we use a lightweight mobile camera projector unit to augment the paper map with a projected overlay of the buddies' positions. By using digital and geo-referenced representations of public maps no extra preperation for the tracking is needed. The idea is presented by enhancing Google Latitude, which allows users to browse the positions of their friends, to project the positions directly on the paper map without the cumbersome panning and zooming of a digital map on a small display.

abstract={We conducted a user study to investigate the effect of visual context in handheld augmented reality interfaces. A dynamic peephole interface (without visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The task was to explore objects on a map and look for a specific attribute shown on the display. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. We found that visual context is most effective for sparse item distributions and the performance benefit decreases with increasing density. User performance in the magic lens case approaches the performance of the dynamic peephole case the more densely spaced the items are. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and dynamic peephole interfaces by suggesting when external visual context is most beneficial.},

abstract={in many mid- to large-sized cities public maps are ubiquitous. One can also find a great number of maps in parks or near hiking trails. Public maps help to facilitate orientation and provide special information to not only tourists but also to locals who just want to look up an unfamiliar place while on the go. These maps offer many advantages compared to mobile maps from services like Google Maps Mobile or Nokia Maps. They often show local landmarks and sights that are not shown on standard digital maps. Often these 'YOU ARE HERE' (YAH) maps are adapted to a special use case, e.g. a zoo map or a hiking map of a certain area. Being designed for a fashioned purpose these maps are often aesthetically well designed and their usage is therefore more pleasant. in this paper we present a novel technique and application called PHOTOMAP that uses images of 'YOU ARE HERE' maps taken with a GPS-enhanced mobile camera phone as background maps for on-the-fly navigation tasks. We discuss different implementations of the main challenge, namely helping the user to properly georeference the taken image with sufficient accuracy to support pedestrian navigation tasks. We present a study that discusses the suitability of various public maps for this task and we evaluate if these georeferenced photos can be used for navigation on GPS-enabled devices.},

abstract={Common Geographic Information Systems (GIS) require a high degree of expertise from its users, making them difficult to be operated by laymen. This paper describes novel approaches to easily perform typical basic spatial tasks within a GIS: e.g. pan-, zoom- and selection-operations by using multi-touch gestures in combination with foot gestures. We are interested in understanding how non-expert users interact with such multi-touch surfaces. We provide a categorization and a framework of multi-touch hand gestures for interacting with a GIS. This framework is based on an initial evaluation. We present results of a more detailed in situ-study mainly focusing on multi-user multi-touch interaction with geospatial data. Furthermore we extend our framework using a combination of multi-touch gestures with a small set of foot gestures to solve geospatial tasks. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Efficient and effective communication between mobile units and the central emergency operation center is a key factor to respond successfully to the challenges of emergency management. Nowadays, the only ubiquitously available modality is a voice channel through mobile phones or radio transceivers. This makes it often very difficult to convey exact geographic locations and can lead to misconceptions with severe consequences, such as a fire brigade heading to the right street address in the wrong city. In this paper we describe a handheld augmented reality approach to support the communication of spatial information in a crisis response scenario. The approach combines mobile camera devices with paper maps to ensure a quick and reliable exchange of spatial information. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper we present ideas that can help to close the gap between virtual reality and embedded interaction, which are usually assumed to be the two extremes of a dimension that describes mixed reality interaction. We present our preliminary ideas on surface interaction with stereoscopic data as well as our work on mobile camera-projector units. While the first line of research tries to increase the degree of the interaction experience in virtual worlds, the second uses the physical properties of the real world to enhance the augmented reality experience. The first idea uses the physical world to constraint the interaction in the virtual world. The second idea embeds virtual information into the physical world by respecting its physical properties. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-touch interaction has received considerable attention in the last few years, in particular for natural two-dimensional (2D) interaction. However, many application areas deal with three-dimensional (3D) data and require intuitive 3D interaction techniques therefore. Indeed, virtual reality (VR) systems provide sophisticated 3D user interface, but then lack efficient 2D interaction, and are therefore rarely adopted by ordinary users or even by experts. Since multi-touch interfaces represent a good trade-off between intuitive, constrained interaction on a touch surface providing tangible feedback, and unrestricted natural interaction without any instrumentation, they have the potential to form the foundation of the next generation user interface for 2D as well as 3D interaction. In particular, stereoscopic display of 3D data provides an additional depth cue, but until now the challenges and limitations for multi-touch interaction in this context have not been considered. In this paper we present new multi-touch paradigms and interactions that combine both traditional 2D interaction and novel 3D interaction on a touch surface to form a new class of multi-touch systems, which we refer to as interscopic multi-touch surfaces (iMUTS). We discuss iMUTS-based user interfaces that support interaction with 2D content displayed in monoscopic mode and 3D content usually displayed stereoscopically. In order to underline the potential of the proposed iMUTS setup, we have developed and evaluated two example interaction metaphors for different domains. First, we present intuitive navigation techniques for virtual 3D city models, and then we describe a natural metaphor for deforming volumetric datasets in a medical context. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We demonstrate how multi-touch hand gestures in combination with foot gestures can be used to perform navigation tasks in interactive systems. The geospatial domain is an interesting example to show the advantages of the combination of both modalities because the complex user interfaces of common Geographic Information System (GIS) requires a high degree of expertise from its users. Recent developments in interactive surfaces that enable the construction of low cost multi-touch displays and relatively cheap sensor technology to detect foot gestures allow the deep exploration of these input modalities for GIS users with medium or low expertise. In this paper, we provide a categorization of multi-touch hand and foot gestures for the interaction with spatial data on a large-scale interactive wall. In addition we show with an initial evaluation how these gestures can improve the overall interaction with spatial information.},

abstract={The advantages of paper-based maps have been utilized in the field of mobile Augmented Reality (AR) in the last few years. Traditional paper-based maps provide high-resolution, large-scale information with zero power consumption. There are numerous implementations of magic lens interfaces that combine high-resolution paper maps with dynamic handheld displays. From an HCI perspective, the main challenge of magic lens interfaces is that users have to switch their attention between the magic lens and the information in the background. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by using a lightweight mobile camera projector unit to augment the paper map directly with additional information. The "Map Torchlight" is tracked over a paper map and can precisely highlight points of interest, streets, and areas to give directions or other guidance for interacting with the map.},

abstract={With the recent developments in ePaper technology, consumer eBook readers have display qualities and form factors that are approaching that of traditional books. These eBook readers are already replacing paper in some commercial domains, but the potential of eBooks to extend forms of writing and storytelling has not been significantly explored. Using the digital and dynamic characteristics afforded by eBook readers, we are developing iBookmark, a GPS-enabled eBook reader. In iBookmark, writers can create stories that change in response to the location of the eBook itself. By setting context variables based on current and past locations of the eBook reader and using these in the rule-based generation of text and illustrations. We are developing new rhetorical device for writers that extend the expressive range of eBook delivered stories.},

abstract={This article reports on two user studies investigating the effect of visual context in handheld augmented reality interfaces. A dynamic peephole interface (without visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The task was to explore items on a map and look for a specific attribute. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. Hand motion patterns and eye movements were recorded. We found that visual context is most effective for sparsely distributed items and gets less helpful with increasing item density. User performance in the magic lens case is generally better than in the dynamic peephole case, but approaches the performance of the latter the more densely the items are spaced. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and dynamic peephole interfaces, involving spatially tracked personal displays or combined personal and public displays, by suggesting when to use visual context. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009.},

abstract={Tourism provides over six percent of the world's gross domestic product. As a result, there have been many efforts to use technology to improve the tourist's experience via mobile tour guide systems. One key bottleneck in such location-based systems is content development; existing systems either provide trivial information at a global scale or present quality narratives but at an extremely local scale. The primary reason for this dichotomy is that, although good narrative content is more educationally effective (and more entertaining) than a stream of simple, disconnected facts, it is time-intensive and expensive to develop. However, the WikEar system uses narrative theory-informed data mining methodologies in an effort to produce high-quality narrative content for any location on Earth. It allows tourists to interact with these narratives using their camera-enabled cell phones and an innovative interface designed around a magic lens and paper map metaphor. In this paper, we describe a first evaluation of these narratives and the WikEar interface, which reported promising, but not conclusive, results. We also present ideas for future work that will use this feedback to improve the narratives.},

abstract={A user study was conducted to compare the performance of three methods for map navigation with mobile devices. These methods are joystick navigation, the dynamic peephole method without visual context, and the magic lens paradigm using external visual context. The joystick method is the familiar scrolling and panning of a virtual map keeping the device itself static. In the dynamic peephole method the device is moved and the map is fixed with respect to an external frame of reference, but no visual information is present outside the device's display. The magic lens method augments an external content with graphical overlays, hence providing visual context outside the device display. Here too motion of the device serves to steer navigation. We compare these methods in a study measuring user performance, motion patterns, and subjective preference via questionnaires. The study demonstrates the advantage of dynamic peephole and magic lens interaction over joystick interaction in terms of search time and degree of exploration of the search space.

abstract={Providing indoor navigation within a building is usually associated with large investments in infrastructure. We present and evaluate an approach to provide indoor navigation with minimal infrastructure investments. In our approach people use a mobile camera device like a mobile phone as a magic lens. When the device is sweeped over a map of the building, the way is augmented on the camera image of the map. We show that people using our system use more maps and make less errors. The main advantage of our approach is that no tracking of the user is needed - the navigation is solely based on the user's mobile phone and paper maps.},
