abstract={Wireless industrial radio communication systems spawn a new set of requirements with focus on high reliability and low latency. These requirements were identified in the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) initiative as well as in 5th Generation (5G) mobile communication standardization in the form of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC).Specifically Closed-Loop-Control (CLC) applications exhibit periodic deterministic communication with short packets. These applications require ultra low latency which bars the application of retransmissions to improve reliability. Also, many CLC applications are very sensitive to burst errors but can tolerate single packet loss. Therefore, we propose to shift the focus from sum-rate maximization to burst error minimization. As a first step, we perform an extensive burst error analysis of state of the art scheduling and Resource Allocation (RA) strategies. We show that any dynamic RA outperforms a static RA by a large margin. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Grasping objects under water is even today one of the biggest challenges when operating robotic systems let it be tele-operated or autonomous. Currently, most of the manipulation tasks under water are performed using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) which handle all industrial maintenance and inspection tasks where there is intervention involved. Manipulation on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is still a research topic as it involves the control of a moving base and the interacting forces in the most challenging configuration.

abstract={Wireless communication is essential for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in order to provide job instructions, forward sensed data or coordinate multiple AUVs working in a swarm. However, communication in the underwater environment is unreliable and does not allow high data rates due to high interference and poor signal propagation conditions. This article reviews existing concepts for underwater communications both from the information transfer as well as from the networking aspect. Introducing semantic communication helps to reduce the amount of transferred data by making use of semantic side information. Opportunistic networks allow end-to-end data forwarding without permanent connectivity and can be extended to make use of the most suitable communication technology when forwarding data with given size and priority. Machine Learning (ML) helps to remember and classify background information to enhance the efficiency of the communication. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Consider following setup: A number of observations from a data source shall be compressed jointly prior to a forward transmission via several rate- limited links to a central processing unit. To design the respective quantizers, here, Mutual Information is chosen as the fidelity criterion and the broad-ranging structure of Multivariate Information Bottleneck is then aptly tailored to that purpose. This, indeed, not only yields a novel design approach for the considered distributed scenario but also paves the way towards perceiving the chance of leveraging this flexible conceptual frame in a vast variety of applications regarding digital data transmission. Explicitly, it immediately enables addressing various extensions of the presumed arrangement, incorporating the parallel construction of intertwined compression systems for several correlated sources. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Satellite communication systems are expected to play an important role in the fifth generation mobile network (5G) for global broadband coverage and service continuity. Constellations with many cooperating small satellites offer great advantages in terms of scalability and flexibility over traditional satellite communication systems with few large satellites. Small satellites means less power and low complexity per satellite while delivering 5G services as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) by exploiting the network of cooperating satellites. Thus, we derive a Distributed Precoding (DiP) algorithm by solving an user averaged Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) optimization problem subject to individual satellite power constraints. To come up with a robust precoder, the proposed design is based on a contamination model taking channel estimation accuracy into account. Simulation results show that the cooperation and processing of the satellite swarm leads to an increase of the Downlink (DL) sum rate. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the distributed state estimation problem where a set of nodes cooperatively estimate the hidden state of a nonlinear dynamic system based on sequential observations. As a common approach to solve this problem, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is considered from a Bayesian perspective. After linearizing the state-space model using the first-order Taylor series, we construct an equivalent maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem under linear Gaussian assumptions coupled with a consensus constraint. The consensus-based MAP problem is solved distributedly by the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). The resulting distributed algorithm ensures robust consensus-based state estimates among nodes and is able to converge to the central solution. © 2019 IEEE},

abstract={We consider the uplink of a non-terrestrial network where a relay node is forwarding digitized signals via a rate limited error-prone forward link to the serving satellite. The focus of our investigations are the design of suitable low-bit resolution quantization schemes to limit the rate on the forward link and the optimization of the decoder processing at the satellite. To this end, we investigate Information Bottleneck (IB) based quantizer design with mutual information as fidelity criterion. The IB approach can be extended to consider also the error statistic of the forward link within the quantizer design. By numerical investigations we demonstrate the performance gains of this forward-aware IB quantizer in case of erroneous forward links. Furthermore, we investigate a lookup-table based decoder which is optimized for the end-to-end statistic including the access link, the quantizer and the forward link. This decoder implementation processes only discrete values using lookup-tables of small size. The numerical results show that the performance of 3-bit forward-aware IB quantizer in combination with a 3-bit discrete decoder implementation is close to the double-precision floating-point belief propagation decoder even for strongly error-prone forward links. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Railways are the safest and most energy-efficient means of land transportation. Unfortunately, they are less attractive than other transportation means due to the relatively high ticket prices and unreliable travel times. Both are a consequence of high running and maintenance costs and inefficient usage of the railway infrastructure. In this article, we introduce new railway applications that increase railway safety and track use. This will accordingly decrease running costs. For instance, automatic train coupling will enable trains to automatically couple when they use the same track section and to automatically separate when they are required to use different tracks. This will enhance energy efficiency, track use, and running costs while maintaining safety requirements. To enable such an application, we introduce an ultra-reliable and low-latency millimeter-wave wireless communication system, the SBDist system, which provides direct communication and ranging between trains. We show from measurement data and simulations that the SBDist system achieves round-trip latency values below 50 ms and that the packet error rate values are enhanced by using circularly polarized antennas and applying a novel redundancy scheme. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

funding_text 1={Automatic train coupling (ATC) is the process of automatically connecting or disengaging trains physically. These maneuvers can happen while both trains are mobile, or when one train is stationary and the other train is moving. The latter could occur at platforms or shunting yards. ATC requirements are less excessive compared to virtual coupling. Still, reliability and latency requirements increase as the distance between the trains decreases. In other words, URLLC will be required at short distances between trains less than 50 m apart. Therefore, a URLLC system introduced in [6], namely the SBDist system, is considered for ATC at short distance. SBDist is a project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany and is short for secure and low-latency broadband transmission over short distances [7].},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a dynamic train-to-train (T2T) millimeter wave (mmWave) propagation measurement campaign to enable the automatic train coupling application. mmWave frontends with directive antennas were installed on the couplers of two trains where the channel impulse response was recorded throughout the measurements. The campaign covered more than 30 recorded measurements in different environments. Received signal power in the open field area was analyzed and modeled using a two-ray pathloss model. Results indicate that the received power next to a platform was higher compared to the open field counterpart due to strong contributions from the signals reflected by the platform. Distance estimation accuracy between the transmitter and the receiver using a snapshot based estimator was evaluated and 1σ accuracy of 12 cm was achieved. © 2019 European Association on Antennas and Propagation.},

abstract={Recently, the wireless commuication system development driven by the ongoing Industry 4.0 (I40) and Indusrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) has been growing enormously. In industrial automation and manufacturing, closed-loop control applications are commonly used, which require completely new solutions to achieve latencies of 1ms with extremely high reliability and stringent requirements on message timing and repetitive packet losses. A hardware-based solution for baseband signal processing aiming at such challenges is introduced in this work. With a novel design and integration of the baseband signal processing blocks, the key highlights of this solution are a) multi-user support, b) simple and flexible integration in the industrial application, c) low hardware overhead, and d) high data throughput with low latency. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Reconstructing spatial fields by sensor networks is a common problem in environmental monitoring applications. Usually, this task requires nonlinear techniques due to the underlying physical process. The so-called KDiCE algorithm is able to estimate such a spatial field in a distributed fashion by a nonlinear regression using kernel methods. To further enhance its reconstruction performance we consider a mobile sensor network in this paper. We utilize an iterative distributed scheme based on centroidal Voronoi tessellation where the sensors move to the center of mass of their Voronoi region. We include this sensor movement into the KDiCE algorithm and provide performance results regarding a distributed reconstruction of diffusion fields. Our evaluations show a significant gain in the performance by including sensor movement. © VDE Verlag GMBH. Berlin. Offenback. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Compressed Sensing Multiuser Detection (CS-MUD) is a novel approach towards decreased signalling overhead in Massive Machine Type Communications (MMC). At its core CS-MUD employs techniques from Compressed Sensing and sparse signal processing to detect activity and data of nodes in MMC directly at the PHY. This approach inherently requires proper control of errors occurring at the activity detection as false alarm and missed detection errors. These two error events heavily impact the system performance and also impact the performance of higher layer error handling techniques. To simplify handling of activity errors, this paper introduces a new algorithm to keep one of these error rates constant over the whole SNR while minimizing the counterpart. This approach is commonly known as Neyman-Pearson detection and allows for detection at constant false alarm or constant missed detection rate. To employ Neyman-Pearson detection in CS-MUD we introduce a so called adaptive threshold Neyman-Pearson approach which is based on activity Log Likelihood ratios. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

abstract={Lossy data compression has been studied under the celebrated Rate-Distortion theory which provides the compression rate in order to quantize a signal without exceeding a given distortion measure. Recently, with information bottleneck an alternative approach has been emerged in the field of machine learning. The fundamental idea is to include the original source into the problem setup when quantizing an observation variable and to use strictly information theoretic measures to design the quantizer. This paper yields an insight to this framework, discusses corresponding algorithms and their performance, and provides a new algorithmic approach of low complexity. © VDE Verlag GMBH. Berlin.

abstract={Multi-carrier schemes with general waveforms are flexible bandwidth efficient transmission schemes offering a robust design regarding practical impacts like carrier frequency offset and timing offsets. Especially for two phase two way relaying channels (TWRC) where two users simultaneously transmit data on the same resources, a robust design in presence of practical constraints is important. This paper focuses on the equalization at the relay with factor graph based techniques reducing the impact of the physical channels and offsets. The combination of general waveforms and factor graph based equalizers offers a flexible structure giving control of the complexity and FER performance at the relay. Hence, we fully describe a TWRC transmission by factor graphs for general multi-carrier transmissions, which gives us a framework on iterative detection of the relay message based on the sum-product algorithm. It turns out that well localized waveforms applying a factor graph based equalizer outperforms OFDM w.r.t. FER performance under practical constraints. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={This paper presents several new distributed algorithms to solve consensus based estimation problems in a decentralized way by adopting the well-known relaxation methods Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and successive over-relaxation within a sensor network. In distributed estimation, all nodes collaborate to estimate the signals emitted from some common sources, employing iterative processing with one-hop data exchange. Consequently, the Jacobi-based consensus estimation algorithm produces a considerable communication effort due to its parallel processing. On the contrary, significant overhead can be saved by the Gauss-Seidel based consensus estimation algorithm with sequential update and exchange of local information. Additionally, both distributed algorithms can be accelerated by successive over-relaxation, resulting in further reduction of the communication effort for the distributed estimation. The evaluation of all the algorithms has been carried out in presence of both ideal and erroneous inter-node links in a randomly generated network. Moreover, the influence of the network topology on the distributed estimation has also been investigated, and the simulative results indicate that a network with low connectivity is preferred by the proposed algorithms. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={In a dense small-cell (SC) network with several users to be served, a multi-user detection (MUD) can be employed across SCs, and distributed estimation is a promising technique for such a scenario. Nevertheless, large communication overhead due to frequently exchange of variables among SCs will cause high energy consumption and processing latency. This paper is focused on the reduction of communication overhead for the distributed processing. To this end, two algorithms, Augmented Lagrangian based Cooperative Estimation (ALCE) and Priority-aided ALCE (PALCE) will be presented. In ALCE a new efficient approach is adopted to achieve parallel processing among all SCs, which needs fewer variables to be exchanged. Thus, a considerable amount of overhead will be saved. However, the ALCE algorithm is not robust when applied to a network with erroneous backhaul (BH) links, therefore a variant of this approach termed PALCE is proposed using a priority oriented principle to enhance the robustness and maintain low amount of information exchange. The proposed algorithms are investigated by means of error rate and communication overhead showing significant improvement in estimation performance compared to state of the art algorithms. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

abstract={In this paper multi-carrier transmission schemes applying general waveforms are discussed within two-phase two way relay channels. Here, two users communicate simultaneously on the same resources to an assisting relay. The relay has to cope with the superposition of both users, interferences of the channel and additional practical impairments like frequency and timing offsets. To be more robust against these impairments, Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) systems with general waveforms are used. They offer better time-frequency properties by the cost of additional interference introduced by the waveforms than CP-OFDM applying rectangular waveform. The main contribution of this work is the performance analysis w.r.t. the sensitivity against phase differences of the user channels in FBMC with QAM and Offset-QAM (OQAM) modulation. BER performance analysis show that under realistic channel conditions QAM/FBMC outperforms OFDM as well as OQAM/FBMC with one antenna at the relay. If the relay use an additional antenna at the relay, the multi-carrier applying OQAM outperforms QAM modulation. Hence, the choice of OQAM or QAM depends on the number of antennas available at the relay. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={Using general waveforms has recently gained omnipresent attention for robustness in systems under practical constraints. In this paper, two way relaying networks using physical layer network coding utilizing a multicarrier scheme with Gaussian waveforms are analyzed. This combination is introduced to be more robust against the impact of carrier frequency offsets and timing offsets. In two way relaying a multiple access phase is applied, where both users transmit their messages simultaneously on the same resources to an assisting relay. Here, a superposition of both signals containing the influence of the individual channels is received. The additional interference introduced by the non-orthogonal Gaussian filter is treated by a linear equalizer. To reduce complexity the equalizer is simplified to treat adjacent symbols in the time-frequency grid, only. To evaluate the overall performance of the introduced equalizer, different decoding strategies are analyzed by means of a link level simulations. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

At the relay a superposition of both massages is received containing the influence of the channel as well as the impact of Carrier Frequency Offsets (CFOs) and Timing Offsets (TOs), respectively.

The additional interference introduced by the non-orthogonal impulse shape is treated by an additional linear equalizer. The overall system performance of the classical OFDM system and non-orthogonal waveforms is compared for Physical-Layer Network Coding (PLNC) with respect to the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) and the achievable mutual information in the PLNC system.

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are recognized as a key technology in 5G architecture by achieving highly boosted data rates due to the large available bandwidth. For proper mmWave air interface design, the impact of hardware impairments leading to performance degradations have to be considered adequately in practical systems. In this paper, we study the hardware aspects phase noise, non-linear power amplifiers, IQ imbalance, and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution using appropriate models at mmWave frequency and evaluate the performance in an outdoor urban mmWave scenario. The respective influence on two air interfaces, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE), are analyzed and compared. It is shown that SC-FDE is much more robust against impairments from non-linear power amplifiers, IQ imbalance and ADC resolution than OFDM for a typical mmWave system configuration. Although this less robustness of OFDM systems is compensated by channel coding significantly, SC-FDE with minimum mean square error equalization can still outperform OFDM in some coded cases. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={Free licensed spectral bands have become rare due to the increasing number of wireless users and their demand for high data rates. Likewise, the static allocation of these bands results in an under-utilization of the spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged as a promising solution to the dilemma by allowing opportunistic users to transmit in the absence of licensed users. Spectrum sensing is therefore the key component of CR and coexistence management in general. In order to detect as much transmission opportunities as possible, a large bandwidth has to be monitored which according to Shannon-Nyquist necessitates high sampling rates. For fast and accurate spectrum estimation, we propose a novel approach called Compressed Edge Spectrum Sensing (CESS) which exploits the sparsity of power spectrum edges and allows for sampling down to 6% of Nyquist without losses in the detection accuracy of occupied and unoccupied spectrum regions. © EURASIP 2018.},

abstract={We propose an adaptive scheme for distributed learning of nonlinear functions by a network of nodes. The proposed algorithm consists of a local adaptation stage utilizing multiple kernels with projections onto hyperslabs and a diffusion stage to achieve consensus on the estimates over the whole network. Multiple kernels are incorporated to enhance the approximation of functions with several high- A nd low-frequency components common in practical scenarios. We provide a thorough convergence analysis of the proposed scheme based on the metric of the Cartesian product of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. To this end, we introduce a modified consensus matrix considering this specific metric and prove its equivalence to the ordinary consensus matrix. Besides, the use of hyperslabs enables a significant reduction of the computational demand with only a minor loss in the performance. Numerical evaluations with synthetic and real data are conducted showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Consider an extended version of noisy source coding in which the compressed data must be transmitted over an imperfect (forward) channel before being further processed. An interesting criterion for designing the quantizer in such cases is to maximize the end - to-end transmission rate. Since finding the globally optimal solution via the naive brute-force search is practically infeasible, a number of routines have been proposed aiming at providing complexity-wise tractable procedures at the expense of converging to local optima. In this paper, we study the relation between two particular devised heuristics appeared in totally different applications and prove their equivalence through an in-depth analytical investigation of their counterpart algorithmic steps. We further substantiate our presented line of argumentation by means of computer-generated simulations. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of distributed state estimation, where a set of nodes are required to jointly estimate the state of a linear dynamic system based on sequential measurements. In our distributed scenario, all the nodes 1) are interested in the full state of the observed system and 2) pursue a consensus-based state estimate with high accuracy. We exploit the equivalent relation between the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation and the Kalman filter (KF) in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense under the Gaussian assumption. Utilizing this relation, a distributed Kalman filtering algorithm is derived, which ensures consensus-based state estimates among nodes and converges to the optimal central KF solution. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a hybrid dictionary approach for distributed kernel-based adaptive learning of a nonlinear function by a network of nodes. The hybrid dictionary incorporates a local part to improve learning of high frequency components in the function within the local domain of each node and a global part to provide a consensus estimate of the function over the whole region of interest. We apply our scheme to the reconstruction of a spatial distribution by a network of mobile nodes. Performance evaluations show that high frequency components are reconstructed accurately by our hybrid dictionary approach while common schemes are not able to recover them completely. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel distributed precoding (DiP) algorithm for ultra-dense small cell (SC) networks is developed, where the SCs cooperate to perform a joint transmission to users (UEs) with limited and individual transmit powers. Different to most state of the art (SotA) DiP algorithms, the proposed precoder design is based on the assumption that each SC has only local channel state information (CSI) available. Additionally, there are no constraints on the number of antennas for each SC, but only one constraint on the sum of all transmit antennas. A solution for the considered problem based on the Lagrangian method of multipliers (MoM) is presented, by formulating the precoder design as a constrained convex optimization problem. The obtained solution can be implemented in a fully distributed way among the SCs by using the preconditioned Richardson (PR) iteration. In numerical simulations, the convergence of the proposed DiP algorithm is verified and it is shown that the sum rate significantly increases, if the SCs cooperate with each other. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce a millimeter wave (mmWave) channel sounder design to enable dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle propagation measurements such as short range train-to-train and different car platooning scenarios. The RUSK-DLR channel sounder has been extended with mmWave frontends to up-and down-convert intermediate signals. This combination is enabling us to perform accurate mmWave propagation measurements in a dynamic manner. The design of the frontends and the evaluation through lab tests and outdoor measurements are described. Outdoor measurements covered static and dynamic scenarios. Measurements at ranges up to 110 m were performed. We could accurately record channel impulse responses, phase measurements and delay information in the different scenarios. Furthermore, we could show a good match between the theoretical free space path loss and empirical received power and evaluate the influence of multipath propagation on the distance estimate. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of noisy source coding, contrary to the conventional Rate-Distortion theory, the so-called Information Bottleneck method formulates the existent fundamental complexity-precision trade-off in a symmetric and purely information-theoretic fashion. Since the pertinent optimization task to design the quantizer is quite demanding, a number of heuristics have been developed to provide practically feasible procedures at the expense of yielding suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we consider two pertinent routines originally appeared in totally different applications and set out to precisely prove their algorithmic equivalence by conducting a thorough analysis over the corresponding algorithmic steps. We further corroborate our theoretical investigation employing computer-based simulations. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The fifth generation of cellular communication systems is foreseen to enable a multitude of new applications and use cases with very different requirements. A new 5G multi-service air interface needs to enhance broadband performance as well as provide new levels of reliability, latency, and supported number of users.

abstract={Compressive Sensing Multi-User Detection (CSMUD) is a recently developed physical (PHY) layer technique [1] to support Massive Machine Communication (MMC) in the next generation of mobile communication (5G) [2], [3]. CS-MUD has been investigated in joint Medium Access Control (MAC) and PHY layer protocol design [4], [5] but the lack of analytical performance description makes the joint design cumbersome. To expand the joint MAC-and PHY-layer protocol design considering a larger parameter space and to gain insights in the cross-layer optimization, we present a performance abstraction for CS-MUD to avoid extensive numerical simulation. Within this work, we exploit a low-complexity approach to approximate the performance of CS-MUD through the Replica Symmetry in large system analysis [6]. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-carrier transmission schemes with general non-orthogonal waveforms provide a flexible time-frequency resource allocation and are bandwidth efficient. However, the interference inherently introduced by the non-orthogonal waveforms always requires a higher order equalizer at the receiver. Depending on the localization properties of the applied waveform, the structure and the complexity of this equalizer is adapted to consider channel influences, like carrier frequency and timing offsets. Especially for two-phase two-way relaying channels (TWRCs), where two users simultaneously transmit data on the same resources, a robust transmission scheme in presence of practical constraints such as asynchronicity is of utmost importance. This paper focuses on the utilization of general multi-carrier transmission schemes applied to TWRCs and the utilization of factor graph-based equalizers (FGEs) at the relay in order to mitigate the impacts of the physical channels, offsets, and the non-orthogonal waveforms. In combination with the subsequent physical-layer network coding detection/decoding scheme, this combination allows for a flexible design of the waveforms and the FGE to meet the complexity-performance trade-off at the relay. As demonstrated by numerical evaluation results, the proposed multi-carrier scheme with well-localized waveforms utilizing FGEs outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in TWRC for a wide range of practical impacts. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The main focus of this paper is on the problem of noisy source coding wherein observed signals from an inaccessible source shall be compressed. To that end, rather than resorting to the conventional methods from Rate-Distortion theory, the so-called Information Bottleneck paradigm is deployed in order to obtain a highly informative representing signal w.r.t. the given source. An efficient, generic and highly flexible graph-based message passing routine for clustering, known as the Affinity Propagation is successfully applied here as a novel treatment for that purpose. The fundamental differences and the performance-wise comparison w.r.t. the state-of-the-art KL-Means-IB algorithm is provided as well. © 2018 IEEE.},

We performed a measurement campaign and analyze the vibration data to relate the wagon-to-wagon channel with the train vibrations. We show the effect of Doppler frequency shifts caused by vibrations on Doppler spread and channel coherence time. We show that the coherence time has large values which means that the channel will have a static behavior for short packets used in wagon-to-wagon wireless train control and management systems (TCMS). © Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The Compressed Sensing (CS) framework is heavily utilized to reduce data rate in hardware restricted scenarios by exploiting the intrinsic sparsity of the transmitted data. Considering multiple sensors at the same time, one variation of the Multi Channel (MC) framework takes several measurements at one time instant and then uses CS in the spatial domain to compress the data. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed system by computing the coherence and the Restricted Isometry Constant (RIC) of the corresponding MC sensing matrix. Additionally, we provide simulation results to further show the applicability and advantages of this system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose the use of multiple Gaussian kernels for distributed nonlinear regression or system identification tasks by a network of nodes. By employing multiple kernels in the estimation process we increase the degree of freedom and thus, the ability to reconstruct nonlinear functions. For this, we extend the so-called KDiCE algorithm, which allows a distributed regression of nonlinear functions but uses a single kernel only, to multiple kernels. We corroborate our proposed scheme by numerical evaluations for the reconstruction of nonlinear functions both static and time-varying. We achieve performance gains for both cases, in particular for the tracking of a time-varying nonlinear function. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a new approach for distributed consensus-based estimation with low communication effort in cooperative networks, where a group of nodes cooperates to estimate source messages with information exchange achieving consensus among all nodes. A new distributed estimation algorithm is developed by adopting the novel approach of virtual clustering, in which the size of exchanged data is reduced during the distributed processing by the partial transmission after data clustering. Moreover, the required communication effort and estimation performance of the algorithm are evaluated for networks with different topology and varying system parameters. We show that communication cost is reduced considerably by the proposed algorithm while keeping the estimation performance. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={For the always increasing amount of data new tools are needed to effectively harvest important information out of them. One of the core fields for data mining is Dictionary Learning, the search for a sparse representation of given data, which is widely used in signal processing and machine learning. In this paper we present a new algorithm in this field that is based on random projections of the data. In particular, we show that our proposition needs a lot less training samples and is a lot faster to achieve the same dictionary accuracy as state of the art algorithms, especially in the medium to high sparsity regions. As the spark, the minimum number of linear dependent columns of a matrix, plays an important role in the design of our contribution, we coined our contribution SparkDict. © EURASIP 2017.},

abstract={The general problem of quantizing observation signals appears in different aspects of data processing, from special code designs to realization of low-complexity receivers. To this end, a new framework, known as the Information Bottleneck method, has recently attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper, after introducing this framework and providing the Iterative Information Bottleneck algorithm as the primary pertinent solution, we also discuss three other heuristics aiming to solve the similar problem efficiently. Since the resultant solution of considered approaches is locally optimum, it strongly depends on the choice of initialization. The main contribution of this work is to prove the equivalence of these algorithms asymptotically, i.e., assuming an infinite run of algorithms for the extreme case of infinitely large trade-off parameter. We also substantiate this claim by means of computer-based simulations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Massive Machine Communication (MMC) in the next generation of mobile communication (5G) systems requires new Medium Access Control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layer concepts to handle massive access with low overhead. The recently developed concept coded random access is capable of resolving collisions in massive access at MAC layer. Furthermore, Compressive Sensing Multi-User Detection (CS-MUD) achieves joint activity and data detection from the PHY layer perspective by exploiting sparsity in sporadic multi-user detection. In [1], a joint design of these two concepts was semi-analytically evaluated combining CS-MUD with coded random access under certain assumptions, which showed a promising performance for supporting MMC. In this work, a full link-level analysis of the joint protocol will be presented to verify the previous results and provide deep insights on the link-level performance. Although the joint approach on the link-level shows a small throughput loss compared to the semi-analytical evaluation, high system flexibility can be achieved by tuning MAC and PHY resources dynamically based on the numerical analysis which can be referred to in the joint MAC-/PHY-layer design. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The sampling of neural signals plays an important role in modern neuroscience, especially for prosthetics. However, due to hardware and data rate constraints, only spike trains can get recovered reliably. State of the art prosthetics can still achieve impressive results, but to get higher resolutions the used data rate needs to be reduced. In this paper, this is done by expressing the data with exponential and sinusoidal splines. As these signals have a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time, they can be analyzed and reconstructed with the Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) framework. We show, that we can reduce the needed data rate by 90% to achieve the same resolution as without compression. Additionally, we propose analytic boundaries for the reconstruction of these splines and present an algorithm that guarantees the reconstruction within these boundaries. Furthermore, we test the algorithm on real neural stimuli. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) closed-loop control applications require ultra low-latency and ultra high reliability. Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) promises to meet these requirements in conjunction with low Out-Of-Band (OOB) emissions. We present latency measurements of an open-source, modular, portable GFDM software implementation using the GNU Radio framework. The used implementation and its components are investigated regarding their theoretical function. We investigate the usability of the GFDM implementation for Software-Defined Radio (SDR). This is facilitated by benchmarking the various functions with respect to different parameter sets. Thus, we focus on latency measurements which provide reliable figures for SDR system design. Furthermore, we show that low latency broadband SDR systems for I4.0 applications are feasible. © 2017 IEEE.},

For this, we exploit kernel methods which can cope with nonlinear regression tasks and a consensus-based approach to derive a distributed scheme. Both techniques are combined and a distributed kernel-based least squares algorithm for nonlinear function regression is proposed. We apply our algorithm to sensor networks and the distributed estimation of diffusion fields which are known to be highly nonlinear. Performance evaluations regarding static and time-varying fields with multiple sources and arbitrary network topologies are provided showing a successful reconstruction. For the tracking of time-varying fields our proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider a device-To-device scenario in a fragmented spectrum band. Multiple devices transmit complex symbols with a single antenna on distributed, but disjoint OFDM resources. The devices select sufficient frequency resources to enable channel estimation, if the receiver has complete knowledge of the resource map. However, in this scenario the actual allocation map is unknown to the receiver. Therefore, a receiver observing the superposition of all transmitted signals is faced with two problems, channel estimation and identification of the correct resources allocation map. In our previous work [1], we identified the channel and the allocation map of the corresponding users by applying an objective function based on the ℓ1-norm. In this work, we show that successful recovery is possible under different practical ITU channel models. Furthermore, we apply basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) from the compressed sensing framework for channel estimation and show the superior performance in contrast to classical least square estimators. These results show, that identifying non-Adjacent multiuser allocations is possible. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={MTC are expected to play an essential role within future 5G systems. In the FP7 project METIS, MTC has been further classified into mMTC and uMTC. While mMTC is about wireless connectivity to tens of billions of machinetype terminals, uMTC is about availability, low latency, and high reliability. The main challenge in mMTC is scalable and efficient connectivity for a massive number of devices sending very short packets, which is not done adequately in cellular systems designed for human-type communications. Furthermore, mMTC solutions need to enable wide area coverage and deep indoor penetration while having low cost and being energy-efficient. In this article, we introduce the PHY and MAC layer solutions developed within METIS to address this challenge. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The air interface for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications must be designed by properly taking into account the specific characteristics of the wireless channel at higher frequencies. In this work, we start by considering a channel model recently proposed in the literature for mmWave communications in outdoor urban scenarios. First, on top of this channel model we implement a sectorized beamforming model necessary to compensate the large path-loss at mmWave range and study how channel statistics, namely, delay spread and angle spread, are influenced by employing different beamwidths. Subsequently, adopting this beamforming model in the mmWave channel, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems are compared. Extensive link level simulations are performed by considering different beamwidths, line-of-sight (LOS) coverage and channel coding. Numerical results show that SC-FDE using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization performs close to OFDM in coded systems. However, SC-FDE might be beneficial in practice due to much lower peak to average power ratio (PAPR) than OFDM. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We suggest an interweave cognitive radio system with a gray space detector, which is properly identifying a small fraction of unused resources within an active band of a primary user system like 3GPP LTE. Therefore, the gray space detector can cope with frequency fading holes and distinguish them from inactive resources. Different approaches of the gray space detector are investigated, the conventional reduced-rank least squares method as well as the compressed sensing-based orthogonal matching pursuit and basis pursuit denoising algorithm. In addition, the gray space detector is compared with the classical energy detector. Simulation results present the receiver operating characteristic at several SNRs and the detection performance over further aspects like base station system load for practical false alarm rates. The results show, that especially for practical false alarm rates the compressed sensing algorithm are more suitable than the classical energy detector and reduced-rank least squares approach. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.},

In this paper we use methods from channel coding to create the CS recovery algorithm RSCS in the Multiple Measurement Vector case (MMV) that uses a specifically constructed measurement matrix. In particular, we use a modified Reed Solomon encoding-decoding structure to measure sparsely representable vector systems down to the theoretical minimum number of measurements.

abstract={We consider a device-to-device scenario, where multiple users transmit complex symbols with constant amplitude on exclusive OFDM resources. However, the spectrum usage and therefore the assignment of resources by each user is unknown at the receiver. The number of resources allocated by each user are well chosen, so that the sparse channel characteristics can be coarsely estimated once the correct resource assignment is known. The receiver faces an inverse problem with two unknowns, the resource allocation and the spectral channel power. We propose an objective function, which identifies the correct resource assignment by just observing the received signal and exploiting the sparse channel properties. We show by simulations based on a practical-relevant ITU channel model, that the objective function is well chosen and one can recover the user allocations under the presence of noise. These results enable us to identify non-adjacent spectrum usage belonging to the same transmitter which goes beyond edge-detection strategy usually used in this context. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Sleep mode techniques for small cells provide an effective means to mitigate excessive energy consumption and interference associated with ultra-dense small cell deployments. Nevertheless, such techniques can impact network performance in traditional deployments. In this paper, we show that in the particular case of macro-controlled small cells, such as in the Phantom Cell Concept (PCC) architecture, effective macro-assisted energy savings schemes can be employed to reduce the network energy consumption at practically no additional cost to the network and no hit to user quality of service (QoS). We introduce a heuristic algorithm suitable for real network operation, that minimizes the energy consumption in the small cell network by selecting the small cell offering the best signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR). We apply this heuristic to three energy savings schemes realizable in the PCC architecture. These schemes,based on the macro-assisted user equipment (UE)-small cell connection establishment paradigm, are a downlink (DL) signalling based scheme, an uplink (UL) signalling based scheme and a database-aided scheme. We derive a power consumption model for a representative PCC small cell, which allows to quantify the percentage of energy consumed by a small cell in sleep mode with respect to a fully operational small cell for the three energy savings schemes considered. Furthermore, we characterize the connection latency associated with each scheme and evaluate the impact on system performance. System-level simulations show that, even with the associated connection delays, the macro-assisted energy-saving schemes can yield energy savings of more than 45 % while at the same time introduce throughput gains of up to 25 %. © 2015, Ternon et al.},

abstract={Future 5G deployments will embrace a multitude of novel technologies that will significantly change the air interface, system architecture, and service delivery platforms. However, compared to previous migrations to next-generation technologies, this time the implementation of mobile networks will receive particular attention. The virtualization of network functionality, the application of open, standardized, and inter-operable software, as well as the use of commodity hardware, will transform mobile-network technology. In this article we focus on the benefits, challenges, and limitations that accompany virtualization in 5G radio access networks (RANs). Within the context of virtualized RAN, we consider its implementation requirements and analyze its cost. We also outline the impact on standardization, which will continue to involve 3GPP but will engage new players whose inclusion in the discussion encourages novel implementation concepts. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Energy savings schemes, in which unused small cells are put into a low power sleep mode, are an efficient way to reduce the energy consumption in Phantom Cell Concept (PCC) systems. Existing energy savings schemes, in which a user equipment (UE) is connected to a small cell whenever it needs to receive data, yield a significant amount of energy savings. To further reduce the energy consumption of PCC systems, we introduce in this paper two methods making a user connect or not to a small cell, based on the size of arriving files. Performance results show that using the size of the file to be received as an additional cell selection parameter can yield a further 5% energy savings in certain conditions, at minimal cost to user quality of service (QoS), with respect to the amount of energy savings obtained with existing schemes. © 2015 University of Split, FESB.},

abstract={In slotted random access of many nodes, multi-user detection (MUD) can be applied to handle collisions. One novel PHY layer approach for jointly detecting activity and data in such a setting is Compressed Sensing based Multi-User Detection (CS-MUD). In this paper, we first summarize previous investigations on CS-MUD and subsequently propose two novel solutions for problems which have not yet been fully addressed: Firstly, we improve on previous results, by introducing a new approach which incorporates the channel decoder into the Compressed Sensing (CS) detector. Secondly, we analyze the resource efficiency of CS-MUD by adapting phase diagrams known from CS literature to the application of sporadic communication. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Sleep mode techniques can provide energy savings in Phantom Cell Concept (PCC) systems. However, the impact of the traffic profile on the performance of these energy savings schemes is not well understood. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of the size of transmitted files on the network performance. Contrary to previous findings, we show that for smaller file sizes the connection latencies associated with different energy savings schemes do have a non-negligible impact on system performance. However, as the file size increases, the influence of the connection delays associated with different schemes becomes negligible.

abstract={The performance of physical-layer network coding (PLNC) in two way relay channels (TWRCs) is significantly decreased by impairments like carrier frequency offsets or timing offsets. This mismatch cannot be completely compensated at the receiver side, even if the offsets are known. Multi-carrier systems with Gaussian waveforms for TWRC systems are more robust against the impact of these offsets. In comparison to rectangular multi-carrier systems, Gaussian waveforms have a better time-frequency shape and they provide improved spectral efficiency due to lower out of band radiations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-carrier TWRC system with Gaussian waveforms and develop an adapted soft interference cancellation (SIC) equalizer to consider the intrinsic interference of the Gaussian transmit/receive filters. The presented results show, that systems with Gaussian waveforms achieve bit error rates close to the rectangular waveforms in PLNC systems while being more robust against Doppler and delay spreads. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Massive Machine Type Communication is seen as one major driver for the research of new physical layer technologies for future communication systems. To handle massive access, the main challenges are avoiding control signaling overhead, low complexity data processing per sensor, supporting of diverse but rather low data rates and a flexible and scalable access. To address all these challenges, we propose a combination of compressed sensing based detection known as Compressed Sensing based Multi User Detection (CS-MUD) with multicarrier access schemes. We name this novel combination Multicarrier CS-MUD (MCSM). Previous investigations on CS-MUD facilitates massive direct random access by exploiting the signal sparsity caused by sporadic sensor activity. The new combined scheme MCSM with its flexibility in accessing time frequency resources additionally allows for either reducing the number of subcarriers or shortening the multicarrier symbol duration, i.e., we gain a high spectral efficiency. Simulation results are given to show the performance of the proposed scheme. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Compressed sensing based multiuser detection is a novel research field in massive machine to machine communication. Mainly focusing at decreasing signaling overhead, this approach implements sophisticated detection algorithms at the physical layer that jointly estimate activity and data. As a consequence, the reliability of the activity detection is crucial for the system performance as data is lost if users are erroneously classified as inactive. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate node activity on a per frame basis by Multiple Measurement Vector Compressed Sensing approaches. This approach allows for reliable activity detection with complexity invariant of the length of the transmitted frame. Moreover, we are able to show that this approach works with only a few measurements available to the detector. In particular we demonstrate that reliable activity detection is possible if the number of observations is larger than the square root of the number of nodes in the system. © 2014 IEEE.},

Furthermore, at the PHY layer, compressive sensing based multi-user detection (CS-MUD) is a novel technique that exploits sparsity in multi-user detection to achieve a joint activity and data detection.

abstract={In this paper we consider adaptive, distributed two-way relaying networks using physical-layer network coding (PLNC). In the multiple-access (MA) phase, two sources transmit simultaneously to multiple relays. Depending on the decoding success at the relays, adaptive transmission schemes are investigated to avoid error propagation in the broadcast (BC) phase employing distributed orthogonal space-time block codes (D-OSTBCs). Recently, adaptive schemes have been proposed, where only relays with correct estimates of the network coded message participate in the BC transmission. In this work, we extend the analysis by incorporating also the case, that some relays are able to detect only one source message and propose a corresponding modified adaptive transmission scheme. For performance evaluations we resort to a semi-analytical method in order to examine the outage behavior of the presented schemes. As demonstrated by link-level simulations, the proposed adaptive scheme outperforms the traditional scheme significantly, especially for asymmetric network topology. © 2014 EURASIP.},

abstract={In distributed networks several nodes aim to estimate the signals broadcasted by the sources in a cooperative fashion by exchanging information among neighboring nodes. Consensus based estimation is a specific class of In-Network- Processing (INP) techniques and the Distributed Consensusbased Estimation (DiCE) algorithm is an efficient realization for the Least Squares (LS) estimation problem. In this paper, we modify the update functions of the DiCE algorithm by applying Nesterov's optimal gradient descend method leading to the novel fast-DiCE algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the distributed estimation algorithms with respect to the MMSE-criterion. The performance of the discussed schemes will be evaluated considering two different applications: a cooperative sensor network and the uplink of a small-cell mobile communication network. The results indicate the improved convergence of the fast-DiCE algorithm resulting also in a reduced communication overhead among the cooperating nodes. © VDE Verlag GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel setpoint-based design approach for Irregular Repeat Accumulate (IRA) codes in iterative detection and decoding structures is presented. In contrast to conventional IRA code design in which the convolutional decoder is combined with the detector, the goal behind this approach is to keep the IRA decoding structure consisting of convolutional decoder and repetition decoder intact, i.e. to consider it as an inner loop of the overall detection structure. The outer loop is then composed of the IRA decoder and the system specific detector. This approach requires to adapt the irregular repetition code jointly to the convolutional decoder as well as to the detector which is achieved by formulating setpoints for the inner and outer code characteristic. As will be shown, the presented code design approach, although starting from a completely different viewpoint as the conventional approach, leads to an irregular repetition code with a very similar transfer characteristic and code rate than the conventional approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses two approaches of reliability-based HARQ, adapting the packet size of a retransmission in a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. We focus on the adaptation of the retransmission size in terms of physical resources by using information 1) of the channel, namely the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or 2) reliability information from the decoder output, taking the overall transmission into account. Both approaches will be compared to the HARQ system used in LTE in terms of throughput performance. Link level simulations will be performed with single bit feedback and 2 bit multilevel ACK/NAK. This work takes realistic impairments such as channel estimation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation and implementation of a Turbo en- and decoder into regard. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we consider physical-layer network coding (PLNC) in OFDM-based two-way relaying systems. Practically, a key impairment for the application of PLNC is the carrier frequency offset (CFO) mismatch between the sources and the relay, which can not be compensated completely in the multiple-access (MA) phase. As this CFO mismatch results in inter-carrier interference (ICI) for OFDM transmissions, practical CFO compensation and ICI cancelation strategies are investigated to mitigate the impairment for a-posterior probability (APP) based PLNC decoders at the relay. Furthermore, we perform hardware implementation of the two-way relaying network employing an long term evolution (LTE) near parametrization adapted to PLNC. The APP-based decoding schemes with CFO compensation and ICI cancelation are applied on this real-time transmission platform to verify the analytical results. © VDE Verlag GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={Machine-type communications are quite often of very low data rate and of sporadic nature and therefore not well-suited for nowadays high data rate cellular communication systems. Since signaling overhead must be reasonable in relation to message size, research towards joint activity and data estimation was initiated. When the detection of sporadic multi-user signals is modeled as a sparse vector recovery problem, signaling concerning node activity can be avoided as it was demonstrated in previous works. In this paper we show how well-known K-Best detection can be modified to approximately solve this finite alphabet Compressed Sensing problem. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust against parameter variations and even works in cases where fewer measurements than unknown sources are available. © 2014 EURASIP.},

abstract={Sporadic machine-to-machine communication requires a signaling efficient medium access strategy, which can be achieved by compressed sensing based multi-user detection (CS-MUD). This novel application for Compressed Sensing requires adapted reconstruction algorithms considering typical communications assumptions. In order to get fast signal reconstruction, we utilize a smoothed version of the ℓ1-regularization, namely, the elastic-net. Further, we connect this approach with a final projection step to incorporate finite alphabets and introduce a new parameter choice strategy for the elastic-net: the so-called C-curve. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing draws significant attention in the information technology (IT) community as it provides ubiquitous on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources with minimum management effort. It gains also more impact on the communication technology (CT) community and is currently discussed as an enabler for flexible, cost-efficient and more powerful mobile network implementations. Although centralized baseband pools are already investigated for the radio access network (RAN) to allow for efficient resource usage and advanced multicell algorithms, these technologies still require dedicated hardware and do not offer the same characteristics as cloud-computing platforms, i.e., on-demand provisioning, virtualization, resource pooling, elasticity, service metering, and multitenancy. However, these properties of cloud computing are key enablers for future mobile communication systems characterized by an ultradense deployment of radio access points (RAPs) leading to severe multicell interference in combination with a significant increase of the number of access nodes and huge fluctuations of the rate requirements over time. In this article, we will explore the benefits that cloud computing offers for fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and investigate the implications on the signal processing algorithms. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, two-way relaying networks are considered using physical-layer network coding in a two-phase protocol. In the multiple access phase, both sources transmit their messages to the relay simultaneously. Subsequently, the relay estimates and broadcasts the XOR-based network coded message back to the sources in the broadcast phase. We concentrate on the critical multiple access phase, where several detection and decoding schemes at the relay are studied and compared with respect to mutual information and system throughput. It is shown, that the system performance of the detection and decoding schemes under investigation is highly dependent on the phase difference of the two incoming messages at the relay, motivating a phase control strategy at the sources before transmission. Simulation results confirm our analysis and the superior performance achieved by phase control in practical systems. © VDE VERLAG GMBH ·Berlin· offenbach.},

abstract={This paper proposes a turbo-like decoding algorithm for network coded HARQ (NC-HARQ) retransmission scheme. Instead of retransmission erroneous packets individually, we send a network coded packet formed by XOR of two incorrectly received packets in the NC-HARQ retransmission. With respect to the two initial packets and one network coded packet, this retransmission scheme can be viewed as a product code based on the Turbo coding principle. We develop an iterative decoding algorithm for the proposed NC-HARQ scheme. The algorithm uses the log-likelihood ratios generated by decoding any two packets to calculate a priori information for the third one. This approach is applicable for both Chase Combing (CC) and Incremental Redundancy (IR). Furthermore, a link adaptation algorithm is investigated for the proposed network coded HARQ scheme. LTE link-level simulations confirm the throughput enhancement by the proposed scheme compared to common HARQ transmission. © VDE VERLAG GMBH Berlin Offenbach.},

After receiving the superimposed signal from both sources, the relay estimates the XOR-based network coded signal, which is broadcast back to the sources. Assuming that the relay is equipped with multiple antennas, the uplink transmission forms a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which allows the application of MIMO detection technologies. To this end, the impact of employing multiple antennas at the relay on different detection and decoding schemes under investigations is studied and compared with respect to mutual information (MI).

In previous works it has been shown for a synchronous CDMA transmission that Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors are capable of jointly detecting both activity and data in multi-user detection (MUD). However, many practical applications show some degree of asynchronicity. In order to reduce transmitter complexity, we propose an enhanced CS MUD that detects the delay in addition to activity and data. This solves synchronicity issues for scenarios with a known maximum delay, without requiring signaling or pre-compensation of asynchronicity. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, distributed Interleave-Division-Multiplexing Space Time Codes (dIDM-STC) in Multi-User Decode-and-Forward Relay Systems are considered. Due to decoding errors at the relays, which are unavoidable in practical systems, error propagation to the destination occurs. In order to cope with this error propagation, recently a Reliability-Aware Iterative Detection Scheme (RAID) at the destination was proposed by the authors, which takes the decoding success at the relays, as well as the decoding reliability of the relays into account. This scheme requires a CRC check and also the estimation of the error probability at each relay. In this paper, a modification of RAID is presented, which only requires a CRC check at the relays, completely avoiding the estimation of the error probabilities at the relays and the signaling to the destination. Instead, the determination of the error probabilities is shifted to the destination reducing the complexity at the relays and the overall signaling overhead. As will be shown, the proposed complexity reduced RAID scheme (CR-RAID) allows for the same end-to-end performance in terms of frame-error-rates as the original RAID. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Performing joint activity and data detection has recently gained attention for reducing signaling overhead in multi-user Machine-to-Machine Communication systems. In this context, Compressed Sensing has been identified as a good candidate for joint activity and data detection especially in scenarios where the activity probability is very low. This paper augments activity and data detection for frame based multi-user uplink scenarios where nodes are (in)active for the duration of a frame. We propose a two stage detector which first estimates the set of active nodes followed by a data detector. Our detector outperforms symbol-by-symbol Maximum a posteriori detection. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine communication requires new physical layer concepts to meet future requirements. In previous works it has already been shown that Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors are capable of jointly detecting both activity and data in multi-user detection (MUD). For this detection we propose a new generalized Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm that allows the use of additional side information regarding the sparsity structure. As a specific example, we exploit the information of a sparsity-aware Viterbi decoder in an iterative feedback loop to improve the activity detection. Here, a significant improvement of the activity detection is already achieved by executing only a single additional detection and decoding step.

abstract={The application of Compresses Sensing is a promising physical layer technology for the joint activity and data detection of signals. Detecting the activity pattern correctly has severe impact on the system performance and is therefore of major concern. In contrast to previous work, in this paper we optimize joint activity and data detection in under-determined systems by minimizing the Bayes-Risk for erroneous activity detection. We formulate a new Compressed Sensing Bayes-Risk detector which directly allows to influence error rates at the activity detection dynamically by a parameter that can be controlled at higher layers. We derive the detector for a general linear system and show that our detector outperforms classical Compressed Sensing approaches by investigating an overloaded CDMA system. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses retransmission approaches to improve the throughput performance of Hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) schemes in a point-to-point single user 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) uplink system. One goal of communication systems is to achieve a reliable transmission with a throughput performance as close as possible to channel capacity. For that, reducing the channel utilization will improve the throughput performance. Instead of sending two retransmission packets for two HARQ processes of one users, a previously published HARQ scheme uses the XOR combining of these packets to get only one retransmission packet with the same size. Similar to this idea, a new varied scheme performs XOR combining of parts of one conventional full retransmission to generate a smaller retransmission packet. Both approaches will reduce the channel utilization. They will be compared with a HARQ system in LTE uplink using a full size retransmission and a half size retransmission. The main focus of this work is the throughput performance evaluation of these schemes in an LTE link-level simulator. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article, distributed interleave-division multiplexing space-time codes (dIDM-STCs) are applied for multi-user two-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relay networks. In case of decoding errors at the relays which propagate to the destination, severe performance degradations can occur as the original detection scheme for common IDM-STCs does not take any reliability information about the first hop into account. Here, a novel reliability-aware iterative detection scheme (RAID) for dIDM-STCs is proposed. This new detection scheme takes the decoding reliability of the relays for each user into account for the detection at the destination. Performance evaluations show that the proposed RAID scheme clearly outperforms the original detection scheme and that in certain scenarios even a better performance than for adaptive relaying schemes can be achieved. © 2013 Lenkeit et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Performing joint detection of activity and data is a promising approach to reduce management overhead in Machine-to-Machine communication. However, erroneous activity detection has severe impacts on the system performance. Estimating an active node or user erroneously to be inactive results in a loss of data. To optimally balance activity and data detection, we derive a novel joint activity and data detector that bases on the minimization of the Bayes Risk. The Bayes Risk detector allows to control error rates with respect to the activity detection dynamically by a parameter that can be controlled by higher layers. In this paper we derive the Bayes Risk detector for a general linear system and present exemplary results for a specific Machine-to-Machine communication scenario. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={ABSTRACT With the expected growth of machine-to-machine communication, new requirements for future communication systems have to be considered. More specifically, the sporadic nature of machine-to-machine communication, low data rates, small packets and a large number of nodes necessitate low overhead communication schemes that do not require extended control signaling for resource allocation and management. Assuming a star topology with a central aggregation node that processes all sensor information, one possibility to reduce control signaling is the estimation of sensor node activity. In this paper, we disuss the application of greedy algorithms from the field of compressive sensing in a channel coded code division multiple access context to facilitate a joint detection of sensor node activity and transmitted data. To this end, a short introduction to compressive sensing theory and algorithms will be given. The main focus, however, will be on implications of this new approach. Especially, we consider the activity detection, which strongly determines the performance of the overall system. We show that the performance on a system level is dominated by the missed detection rate in comparison with the false alarm rate. Furthermore, we will discuss the incorporation of activity-aware channel coding into this setup to extend the physical layer detection capabilities to code-aided joint detection of data and activity. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The standardization of the fourth generation of mobile communication systems was mainly driven by the demands for higher data-rates and improved Quality of Service. To reach these goals interference coordination has been identified as a promising research field for better exploitation of the time and frequency resources. This paradigm shift from interference avoidance to interference coordination is also reflected in the ongoing enhancement of the 4th generation of mobile communication systems such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution. In this context, numerous investigations have focused on the allocation of precoding matrices that are part of the link adaptation process by some form of base station (eNB) coordination. Within this work we develop a non-centralized interference coordination scheme by noticing that the re-allocation of a precoding matrix can lead to an uncontrolled change of the interference level at users located in neighboring cells, especially at the edge. To this end, we provide a fully closed form mathematical framework describing these changes. Based on this, we derive a simple metric that improves the precoding matrix selection process in the User Equipment with the result that interference changes can be reduced without having any standard impact. This novel scheme can also be seen as an extension to previous inter-cell interference coordination schemes without the need of base-station cooperation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine communication requires new physical layer concepts to meet future requirements. In previous works it has already been shown that Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors are capable of jointly detecting both activity and data in Multi-User Detection (MUD). To date, the investigations on CS based MUD have omitted the channel estimation and assumed perfect channel knowledge. However, in practical applications the channel also has to be estimated, such that the joint detection of activity and data has to be extended by channel estimation. Therefore, in this paper we investigate how to adapt several approaches to channel estimation, such that they are suitable for this joint detection and estimation.

abstract={In a cooperative broadcast scenario, a group of nodes in a network aims to reconstruct a common message. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for distributed consensus-based estimation in such scenarios. Possible applications comprise mobile communication systems and sensor networks. Starting with a least squares estimation problem, the algorithm is developed using techniques from optimization theory. The required communication effort for parallel implementation in a resource-constrained network is estimated and compared to existing approaches. We show that the proposed algorithm requires fewer iterations and a reduced communication overhead per iteration while keeping the estimation accuracy. A modification of the algorithm based on an approximation is presented, which reduces the communication effort even further. All results are corroborated by computer simulations considering different system parameters. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, the design of Irregular Repeat Accumulate (IRA) Codes for Interleave-Division Multiple-Access (IDMA)-based multi-pair bidirectional relaying systems is presented. Bidirectional relaying allows to efficiently cope with the loss in spectral efficiency that is inherent to relaying systems due to the half-duplex constraint. However, as soon as multiple communication pairs use one common relay for communication, the question of medium access arises. Since orthogonal medium access schemes again introduce a rate loss to the system, nonorthogonal medium access based on IDMA is proposed. Further, in order to optimize the IDMA-based system regarding spectral efficiency, IRA codes are applied which allow for a highly flexible code design. This paper gives a description of the general code design process based on EXIT-analysis. Moreover, some design examples are given and the resulting systems are compared to conventionally coded IDMA systems based on convolutional codes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider a cooperation among nodes in a network which aim to reconstruct a common broadcast message. Distributed estimation algorithms are highly suited for such a scenario. Nevertheless, communication overhead due to an exchange of variables among nodes can be problematic concerning energy efficiency and costs. In this paper, we present a Reduced Overhead Distributed Consensus-based Estimation (RO-DiCE) algorithm exhibiting a significantly reduced communication overhead in comparison to its unreduced version, the DiCE algorithm. However, by reducing the overhead a possible degradation in estimation performance of the algorithm is introduced. We investigate the RO-DiCE algorithm in terms of communication overhead, convergence behavior and error rate performance for different network topologies. We will show that for a full mesh topology the RO-DiCE algorithm is identical to the DiCE algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to make the Internet of Things a reality, ubiquitous coverage and low-complexity connectivity are required. Cellular networks are hence the most straightforward and realistic solution to enable a massive deployment of always connected Machines around the globe. Nevertheless, a paradigm shift in the conception and design of future cellular networks is called for. Massive access attempts, low-complexity and cheap machines, sporadic transmission and correlated signals are among the main properties of this new reality, whose main consequence is the disruption of the development of the current cellular standards. Here, we provide insights and introduce potential solutions for the cellular radio protocol that will allow the efficient support of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. The paper focuses on the massive aspect of M2M. We will introduce PHY and MAC approaches such as Coded Access Reservation, Coded Random Access and the exploitation of multiuser detection in random access. Additionally, we will show how the properties of machine originated signals, such as sparsity and spatial/time correlation can be exploited. The end goal of this paper is to provide motivation and research guidelines for enabling future networks to support efficiently M2M communications. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper is concerned with the application of distributed Interleave-Division-Multiplexing Space- Time Codes (dIDM-STCs) in relaying systems with error-prone relays applying Decode-and-Forward (DF). In case of erroneous decoding at the relays, error propagation occurs which is not considered by the original detection scheme for IDM-STCs. Hence, a new Reliability Aware Iterative Detection Scheme (RAID) is proposed which takes the decoding success of the relays as well as their decoding reliability into account. By optimally incorporating this knowledge in the detection process at the destination, substantial performance gains compared to the original detection scheme are achieved. The proposed RAID scheme even outperforms adaptive relaying as it explicitly exploits also erroneous relays, which is not the case for the adaptive scheme. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the expected growth of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, new requirements for future communication systems have to be considered. Traffic patterns in M2M communication fundamentally differ from human based communication. Especially packets in M2M are rather small and transmitted sporadically only. Moreover, nodes for M2M communication are often of reduced functionality which makes complex control overhead or resource management infeasible for such devices. Assuming a star-topology with a central aggregation node that processes all node information one possibility to reduce control signaling is to shift the activity detection fully to the central aggregation node. The methodology of a joint activity and data detection differs strongly from common communication scenarios since errors during the activity detection are fundamentally different from errors made at data detection. In this paper we introduce a non-linear joint activity and data detector for M2M communication. The performance regarding data and activity errors is assessed and compared to a scenario where node activity is known by the aggregation node. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={One challenging future application in digital communications is the wireless uplink transmission in sensor networks. This application is characterized by sporadic transmissions by a large number of sensors over a random multiple access channel. To reduce control signaling overhead, we propose that sensors do not transmit their activity states; instead sensor activity is detected at the receiver. As sensors have low activity probabilities, the multi-user vector is in general sparse. This enables Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors to perform joint Multi-User Detection (MUD) of activity and data, by exploiting the sparsity. Since sensors are either active or inactive for several symbol durations, block-wise CS detection can be applied to improve the activity detection. In this paper, we introduce blockwise greedy CS MUD, compare it to symbol-wise greedy CS MUD, and show that statistically independent channels for each symbol further improve the activity detection for block-wise CS detection. Herein, we use Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) as a multiple access scheme. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel HARQ transmission scheme based on network coding is proposed for wireless unicast scenarios. Instead of retransmitting erroneous packets individually, a network coded packet constructed by the XOR of two erroneous packets is transmitted similar to network coding. In order to fully exploit the network coded packet in combination with the previously received erroneous packets, soft combining methods with respect to Chase Combing (CC) and Incremental Redundancy (IR) are developed. The expected throughput gain of 33% for one retransmission for the proposed solution compared to common HARQ transmission is confirmed by LTE link-level simulations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider a two-hop distributed relaying network using orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC), where several relays using Decode-Forward (DF) support the transmission from one source to one destination. In order to mitigate the impact of error propagation for DF, an inter-relay cooperation (IRC) scheme allowing message exchanges among the relays was presented in our previous work based on punctured channel codes. Specifically, one of the relays that decodes the source message correctly re-generates and broadcasts the punctured bits as side information to support the relays with decoding errors for re-decoding. Subsequently, only the error-free relays transmit to the destination using OSTBC. It was shown that this IRC scheme may increase the number of error-free relays when at least one relay decodes the source message correctly. In this paper we focus on the scenario that all relays fail to decode the source message correctly. To this end, an improved IRC scheme is presented based on received signal exchange, in which the whole or part of the received frame are exchanged among the relays to apply signal combining. Additionally, the total energy consumption for signal transmission, baseband processing and RF circuit at all relays is evaluated for practical preferences. It is shown that the improved scheme outperforms our original scheme significantly with respect to the overall system throughput. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we compare two different multiplexing strategies for a two-hop parallel relay channel. Precisely, we show the performance of distributed Interleave-Division-Multiplexing Space-Time Coding (dIDM-STC) and cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (cOFDM) operating in a decode-and-forward relay network, under the constraint of imperfect channel knowledge and timing and carrier frequency offsets. These impairments have to be estimated with either a complete pilot layer in dIDM-STC or orthogonal pilot symbols in cOFDM. While both schemes can cope with timing offsets of integer multiples of the sampling interval very well, cOFDM requires an adjustment of all transmit frequencies in order to avoid inter-carrier interference which would destroy orthogonality of the subcarriers and lead to severe performance degradations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A possible future application in communications is the wireless uplink transmission in sensor networks. This application is mainly characterized by sporadic transmission over a random access channel. Since each sensor has a low activity probability, the signal for Multi-User Detection (MUD) is sparse. Compressive Sensing (CS) theory introduces detectors that are able to recover sparse signals reliably. When applied to MUD, CS detectors perform a joint detection of both data and user activity. This allows for less control signaling, since information about the activity state of each user no longer need to be signaled. Additionally, CS detectors are able to reliably detect sparse signals even in under-determined systems. In the context of transmission with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) this property can be exploited by reducing the length of spreading sequences, which increases the symbol-rate for a given bandwidth, and making the CDMA system overloaded. In this paper we introduce the application of greedy CS detection algorithms to detect CDMA spread multi-user data. © 2011 IEEE.},

Specifically, one of the error-free relays broadcasts punctured bits as side information to help failed relays to re-decode. Consequently, only relays capable of successful decoding transmit to the destination using STBC. Furthermore, an energy model for relays is introduced, so that the proposed IRC scheme can be evaluated with respect to throughput and energy consumptions for transmission, baseband and RF circuit at all relays. Simulation results show the superior performance using IRC, which should be properly designed under the influence of energy considerations. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Interference is an important performance limiting factor in cell-based mobile communication scenarios. Especially entities located at cell edges significantly suffer from inter-cell interference caused by base stations serving users in neighboring cells. The standard of LTE considers a frequency reuse factor of one, which makes inter-cell interference coordination a widely discussed topic. However, most of these techniques lead to a reduction of inter-cell interference instead of a full suppression. Hence, inter-cell interference remains an unpredictable random effect that has to be classified statistically. Within this paper, we derive the probability density function of the inter-cell interference and the resulting SINR PDF, which is given as a non-linear transformation of the interference. Unitary matrix precoding as applied in LTE Rel. 8 is taken into regard. The results are verified by simulative investigations. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we develop a power allocation scheme for single-relay systems applying Decode-and-Forward (DF) based on the resulting bit error rate (BER) at the destination. First, an analytical expression for the BER of M-QAM modulation considering estimation errors at the relay is derived. Based on this expression, the total transmit power is optimally assigned to the source and the relay in order to minimize the probability of errors at the destination. The preciseness of the derived closed form expression as well as the superior performance of the proposed DF-based relaying system are demonstrated by simulation results. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the optimal power routing problem in relay-based cooperative networks, where the relays are arbitrarily positioned. We generalize the standard shortest path routing algorithm (GSPRA) to find an minimum-power distributed MIMO multi-hop route from a source to a destination while satisfying a given e2e outage probability demand. The task of the proposed approach includes how to group relays to virtual antenna array (VAA) and discover the optimal multi-hop path. Instead of using per hop (or link) constraint, which is assumed by most of the existing routing algorithm, an e2e outage probability constraint is assumed for more relevance and freedom in practical systems. Under the concept of virtual node and virtual link, an efficient power allocation solution for general distributed MIMO multi-hop networks is used to calculate link costs for the shortest path algorithm. The proposed routing approach can fully exploit the merits of both cooperative communications and multi-hop transmissions. The significant power savings due to the proposed approach in comparison to the existing algorithms is demonstrated by numerical results. © 2011 IEEE.},

Considering Amplify-and-Forward (AF), Decode-and-Forward (DF) for relaying systems and direct transmission (DT) without relay, we perform a fair comparison with respect to their power consumption in order to achieve the same target BER at the destination. For coded systems, the relationship between the input and the output BERs of the decoder for specific channel codes is modeled by polynomials to facilitate the BER analysis. Additionally, the Feasible Relay Region (FRR) is investigated, which determines geographically when AF or DF outperforms DT. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In general, the unequal RF circuitry in the transmit and receive chains at the base station (BS) prevents the exploitation of the uplink (UL) channel estimate for proper preequalization in time division duplex (TDD) systems. To avoid additional transceiver hardware costs for matching networks, the idea of relative calibration was introduced to cope with the different effective channel impulse responses of UL and downlink (DL) by means of signal processing. However, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission in frequency-selective channels does not allow for classical frequency-domain calibration principles based on total least squares (TLS) approaches. Consequently, more complex structured total least squares (STLS) problems must be solved. In this paper the application of the signal property mapping principle is introduced to iteratively solve the STLS calibration problem. Exemplified by simulation results for single-carrier frequency-domain pre-equalization (SC-preFDE) systems the algorithm indicates good and fast convergence behavior and effectively exploits noisy UL and DL channel measurements for system calibration. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The contribution of this paper is a solution to the problem of allocating terminals to the appropriate access network in locations where an operator owns multiple access networks with overlapping coverage. This problem is destined to arise since the 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) allows operators to efficiently manage multiple access networks under one core network. The underlying assumption of this work is that user preferences, terminals, services and access networks are heterogeneous. While in state-of-the-art methods the network decides which terminal goes to which access network, we propose that this decision is taken at the terminal. The essence of our mechanism is that the network gives the terminals an incentive to hand over from an access network if the operator wants them to do so. The network offers the terminal a reward in form of loyalty program points, free minutes, money, or something alike for a handover. The terminal then decides whether to hand over based on the potential reward and other parameters. We further develop a highly configurable framework which allows a vast amount of terminal allocation methods, including incentive based ones. This is achieved by adopting a terminalcentric network paradigm, i.e., all actions are initiated by the terminals but need to be authorized by the network. © Kommunikation in Verteilten Systemen 2011.},

abstract={ARTIST4G is an integrated project addressing objective 1.1 of the seventh framework program of the European commission: the network of the future. A credible framework is proposed in order to tackle the problem of true ubiquity in the network through proper management of the interference. The three pillars of the project being interference avoidance (at the transmitter), interference exploitation (at the receiver) and advanced relaying are jointly studied driven by appropriate new metrics in the tradition of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) frameworks. Impacts on the architectures of the network are part of the study as well, and the results are validated by means of computer simulations, hardware prototyping and lab tests and field trials to check the models and the critical assumptions on which main results rely. ARTIST4G started in January 2010 and will last 30 months. Copyright © 2010 The authors.},

abstract={Efficiently transmitting data in wireless networks requires joint optimization of routing, scheduling, and power control. As opposed to the universal dual decomposition we present a method that solves this optimization problem by fully exploiting our knowledge of active constraints. The method still maintains main requirements such as optimality, distributed implementation, multiple path routing and per-hop error performance. To reduce the complexity of the whole problem, we separate scheduling from routing and power control, including it instead in the constraint set of the joint optimization problem. Apart from the mathematical framework we introduce a routing and power control decomposition algorithm that uses the active constraint method, and we give further details on its distributed application. For verification, we apply the distributed RPCD algorithm to examples of wireless mesh backhaul networks with fixed nodes. Impressive convergence results indicate that the distributed RPCD algorithm calculates the optimum solution in one decomposition step only. © 2009 Alban Ferizi et al.},

abstract={Coordinated transmission between base stations is one of the techniques under investigation to further improve the system performance of E-UTRA. In general, such a coordination, sometimes also called network MIMO, requires a large amount of signaling between cells. A relatively simple scheme for cell coordination is macro diversity. In this paper we consider macro diversity for the downlink direction of LTE-Advanced as a means to improve cell edge user throughput. We investigate the frequency-selectivity gains offered by over the air combining for different radio channels at link level. The impact on cell throughput as well as on user throughput for mobiles operated in macro diversity mode and for legacy mobile stations is investigated by means of system level simulations. Additionally, open issues related to network coordination are identified for future work. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a near-optimum resource allocation strategy for distributed multiple-input-multiple-output multiple hops multiple commodities OFDMA wireless networks. The novel per-hop-optimization strategy aims to reduce the total transmission power of the network while meeting the individual end-to-end outage probability constraint of each commodity, i.e. for each link of the network. It utilizes the Greedy edge-coloring algorithm to determine reused orthogonal subbands for overlapping hops and allows a distributed implementation per hop. In comparison to other bandwidth allocation strategies like equal or dynamic bandwidth for each commodity, our Per-Hop-Bandwidth- Allocation (PHBA) approach uses the bandwidth in a near-optimum way and reduces the total transmission power significantly. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficiently transmitting data in wireless networks requires an integrated routing and radio resource allocation strategy. An initial observation that suggest dual decomposition to be a worthwhile approach is that the network flow variables for routing and the communication variables for resource allocation are only coupled through link capacities. With dual decomposition we split routing and resource allocation up in two separate subproblems and coordinate the solutions by solving a master dual problem. In this paper, we suggest to solve the master dual problem iteratively by using Aitken's method for an update of the dual variables. In contrast to former proposed subgradient methods, we accelerate the iteration process for achieving an optimum solution. This results in significant less complexity, but still facilitating distributed implementation. Beside describing the application of Aitken's method to simultaneous routing and resource allocation we also give necessary conditions for optimality, and show results for data transmission in a wireless mesh network being optimized in a proportional fair manner. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficiently transmitting data in wireless networks requires an integrated routing, scheduling, and power control strategy. As opposed to the universal dual decomposition we present a method that solve this optimization problem by fully exploiting its combinatorial structure. The method still maintains main requirements such as optimality, distributed implementation, multiple path routing, and per-hop error performance. The method represents a cross-layer approach where we include scheduling in the constraint set of a joint routing and power control optimization problem. Apart from the mathematical framework, the main contribution is a Routing and Power Control Decomposition (RPCD) algorithm. For verification, we compare the RPCD algorithm with state-of-art dual decomposition for wireless mesh backhaul networks. Impressive convergence results indicate that the RPCD algorithm calculates the optimum solution in one decomposition step only. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={A key requirement on future networks is to provide the user with seamless broadband access for triple-play services via any available access technology with high end-to-end quality of service. In this paper we propose a novel resource management concept on the network layer that utilizes service- and user-specific cross-layer metrics to control the resources in an all-Internet Protocol (IP) access network optimally via IP mechanisms such as routing and traffic engineering. We interpret any link, wireless or wireline, as an IP-hop in an all-IP network where major lower layer information is included in such metrics. This approach turns out to be access technology-independent, leading to a unified resource management concept in a "converged" wireline/wireless environment. With this proposal, we leverage flat IP-based cellular architectures like the Alcatel-Lucent Base Station Router (BSR) technologies and show how wireless and wireline access nodes can be integrated into future converged all-IP networks. The paper is based on results from ScaleNet, a European research initiative that is dedicated to advancing a vision of a scalable and flexible next-generation access network that provides an IP-optimized integration of heterogeneous access systems for future broadband multimedia services. © 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.},

abstract={This paper addresses channel allocation for multi-user OFDM systems for real-time packet oriented data transmission. For high data rate wireless communication, optimum utilization of resources has become of utmost importance. The optimum problem we are facing is the minimization of the total transmitted power while meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) and rate requirements in a multi-user OFDM transmission. The idea is to utilize the knowledge of rate requirements not only as a constraint, but also in the channel allocation process. We propose to include the rate requirements in a two-fold manner: i) to perform pre-calculation of the maximum number of channels per user and, ii) to define the set of users competing for the available channels.

abstract={This paper addresses the evaluation of cross-layer metrics for wireless access systems employing Hybrid Automatic Retransmission Request (HARQ) processing combined with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) data transmission. The proposed metrics can be utilized by resource management algorithms to control resources in next generation networks. The objective is twofold. First, we evaluate a reliable throughput performance metric encompassing MIMO as well as HARQ protocol parameters in a single expression. In particular, we perform an information theoretic consideration by employing the conditional cutoff rate for MIMO transmission while the HARQ process is described by the renewal-theory. In a second step, we illustrate the flexibility of the metric evaluation approach by its application to two transmission schemes. Both schemes employ V-BLAST transmission but differ in HARQ processing. Results given for all schemes clearly indicate the suitability of the proposed metrics. With the metrics introduced we also get hints on designing wireless transmission schemes with multi antenna technologies and HARQ processing while avoiding intensive simulation studies. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to investigate linear multiuser detection for the uplink of present mixed service UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) networks in terms of system capacity, system coverage as well as power reduction. For the system performance assessments we apply a two-stage power control multiuser detection algorithm where the users are detected by a multiuser block detection. We evaluate the UTRAN FDD load control parameter noise rise and show corresponding system capacity bounds for different service mixes carried over dedicated channels with data rates up to 64 kbit/s. Note that for typical UTRAN FDD services the signal-to-noise operating points of a multiuser detector are very low (less than 0 dB). These low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) operating points severely limit multiuser detection performance gains. Compared to single-user-matched filtering the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector leads to fairly modest system capacity gains up to 60% dependent on the service mix assumed while the decorrelator is even worse. With respect to coverage as well as mobile station power, MMSE detection indicates fair to high improvements. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper addresses power controlled call admission for interference limited mobile communication networks that controls user classes with different priorities as well as service classes with different quality-of-service constraints. The idea is to mathematically formulate the power controlled admission as a homotopy method. This novel and generic approach enables network operators to flexible define a user/service-specific admission policy in order to handle users with different access priorities and/or different service classes. As an example, we can interactively control the access of high priority users by dynamically adjusting the service quality of already active users with low priority. On the other hand, the proposed approach also allows for safe and soft call admission. That is, to prevent a QoS deterioration in the active links and to assure acceptance of new users, if and only if all users can be supported at their required QoS. Due its generic character the proposed method gains new insight in power control and admission theory. Beside describing the admission approach we also study the existence of power solutions and show results for different predefined admission control functions when applied in a CDMA based cellular system. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to investigate asynchronous linear multiuser detection (MUD) in mixed service UMTS networks in terms of system capacity as well as power reduction at mobile stations. This especially requires to theoretically describe the interaction of linear multiuser detection with radio resource management concepts like power control and load control for asynchronous multirate transmissions. For system capacity assessments we apply a two-stage power control multiuser detection algorithm where the users are detected by a minimum mean square error (MMSE) block detection. By detailed system level simulations we evaluate the UMTS load control parameter noise rise and also show corresponding system capacity bounds for different service mixes. It is important to note that for typical UMTS services the signal-to-noise operating points of the MMSE detector are very low (less than 0 dB). These low SINR operating points severely limit multiuser detection performance gains. Compared to simple single-user matched filtering the MMSE leads to fairly modest capacity gains up to 60% dependent on the service mix assumed. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={An expanded effort is under the way to support the evolution of UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System). Apart from delivering high data rates, future UMTS releases will also require to provide high network performance in terms of system capacity, low radiated power, and high coverage. Well promising performance-enhancing technologies are smart antennas as well as multiuser detection. Although these new radio technologies have recently been subject to intense research, main UMTS network integration aspects with their specific constraints have been neglected in many cases. Especially the interaction with UMTS radio resource control being required to meet Quality of Service (QoS) constraints has to be included to assess the applicability of these technologies for UMTS. In this paper, we study the interaction of beamforming concepts as well as multiuser detection with load and power control. We also work out UMTS specific constraints like signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR) operating points, pilot power pollution or channel estimation, all strongly limiting network performance. Results are shown for capacity gains and power reduction for all beamforming concepts of interest as well as linear multiuser detection schemes. The results show that fix as well as user-specific beamforming significantly improves network performance gains in downlink. In uplink multiuser detection indicates fairly modest system capacity gains, while it reduces tremendously mobile station power. © 2004 Copernicus GmbH.},

abstract={In this paper system level simulation results from the performance evaluation of applicable downlink beamforming concepts for UMTS are presented. For the first time the combination of beamforming and packet data services over UMTS dedicated channels in conjunction with data rate adaptation is investigated. The main focus of this paper is to assess realistic system capacity gains of the different beamforming concepts regarding UMTS specific conditions. Special focus is paid on the comparison of 3/6 sector scenarios with fixed beam switching (FBS) and beam pointing (BP). When applying FBS and BP with 4 antenna elements (4 beams for FBS) a cell throughput gain of about 180...190 % is reached compared to 3 sectors scenario. This gain is coming along with a reduction of the required downlink transmit power dedicated to a specific user. Moreover, due to the lower complexity of the FBS concept and the comparable capacity gain, FBS is preferred to BP.},

abstract={Smart antennas exploit the inherent spatial diversity of the mobile radio channel, provide an antenna gain, and also enable spatial interference suppression leading to reduced intracell as well as intercell interference. Especially, for the downlink of future CDMA-based mobile communications systems, transmit beamforming is seen as a well-promising smart antenna technique. The main objective of this paper is to study the performance of diverse antenna array topologies when applied for transmit beamforming in the downlink of CDMA-based networks. In this paper, we focus on uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA) topologies. For the ULA, we consider three-sector base stations with one linear array per sector. While recent research on downlink beamforming is often restricted to one single cell, this study takes into account the important impact of intercell interference on the performance by evaluating complete networks. Especially, from the operator perspective, system capacity and system coverage are very essential parameters of a cellular system so that there is a clear necessity of intensive system level investigations. Apart from delivering assessments on the performance of the diverse antenna array topologies, in the paper also different antenna array parameters, such as element spacing and beamwidth of the sector antennas, are optimized. Although we focus on the network level, fast channel fluctuations are taken into account by including them analytically into the signal-to- interference calculation.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to investigate linear multiuser detection in an UMTS network in terms of system capacity and system coverage. This includes the impact of linear multiuser detection on radio resource management concepts as load control and power control. One issue the paper deals with is joint optimization of linear multiuser detection with power control. In order to keep practical UMTS issues in mind, we describe an iterative two-stage power control multiuser detection algorithm for UMTS application. With this algorithm detailed system level simulations will be carried out to show coverage and system capacity gains. As an example, we work out the maximum allowable cell radius for a given cell load and outage probability. The main result indicates for UMTS that optimum minimum mean squared error (MMSE) multiuser detection yields moderate gains compared to single-user-matched filtering. The linear decorrelator is even inferior to the single-user-matched filter.},

abstract={This paper addresses aspects of channel coding in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-code-division multiple access (OFDM-CDMA) uplink systems where each user occupies a bandwidth much larger than the information bit rate. This inherent bandwidth expansion allows the application of powerful low-rate codes under the constraint of low decoding costs. Three different coding strategies are considered: the combination of convolutional and repetition codes, the code-spread system consisting of one single very low-rate convolution code and a serial concatenation of convolutional, Walsh-Hadamard and repetition code. The latter scheme is improved by combining the Walsh-Hadamard codes with an additional M-phase-shift keying modulation resulting in complex-valued Walsh-Hadamard codes (CWCs). Analytical performance evaluations will be given for these codes for the first time. The application of CWCs as inner codes in a serial code concatenation is also addressed in this paper. We derive a symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori decoding algorithm in the complex signal space in order to enable iterative decoding for the entire code. A comprehensive performance analysis by simulation of all the proposed coding schemes shows that the Walsh-Hadamard-based schemes are the best choice for low-to-medium system load. Note that even for fully loaded OFDM-CDMA systems, the concatenation with an inner complex-valued Walsh-Hadamard code leads to a bit-error rate less than 10-5 for an Ēb/No of about 6 dB.},

abstract={Apart from providing high system capacity it is essential for mobile communications systems as UMTS to operate with low electromagnetic emission. Smart antennas are one promising technology to establish exposure reduction while upholding system capacity requirements. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to assess the performance improvements of practically applicable beamforming concepts for UMTS networks. The concepts illuminated are fixed as well as adaptive beamforming. To obtain suitable assessments we especially attend three essential aspects. First, proper SINR modelling is considered including spatially formed inter-/intra-cell interference as well as pilot pollution prevailing UMTS networks. Special interest is secondly given on the interaction between UMTS specific radio-resource management algorithms as power-/load control and the smart antenna concepts considered. Finally, we investigate mixed data rate traffic which is expected for UMTS. The simulations are carried out utilizing a combination of UMTS physical and dynamic system level simulators. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={Exploitation of the spatial dimension is a significant issue for third generation wireless networks. The main benefits expected are emission reduction and system capacity enhancements. There are several approaches to exploit the spatial dimension of the mobile channel. Concepts suggested are higher order sectorization (6 sector sites), fixed beam switching concepts (a number of fixed beams covers the area of a sector) and adaptive beamforming (user specific antenna patterns are evaluated). This paper documents the results of a system level investigation considering different antenna concepts when applying power control in UTRA FDD (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access, Frequency Division Duplex) downlink. Furthermore, load control algorithms based on power rise evaluation and user elimination applying a stepwise removal algorithm are also taken into account. Simulations have been carried out for different data services utilizing dedicated channels. The investigations were accomplished within 3GPP-UMTS boundary conditions.},

abstract={This paper investigates aspects of channel coding in CDMA systems where each user occupies a bandwidth much larger than the information bit rate. This inherent bandwidth expansion requires the application of powerful low rate codes with low decoding complexity. In this context, three different coding strategies are under consideration: the combination of convolutional and repetition codes, the code-spread system consisting of a single very low rate convolutional code and finally a serial concatenation of convolutional, Walsh-Hadamard and repetition code. The latter scheme will be iteratively decoded whereas the other two schemes can be maximum likelihood decoded. Analytical and simulation results turn out that the Walsh-Hadamard coded system is the best choice among the considered scenarios for low up to medium system load. Besides these investigations, single- and multi-carrier CDMA are compared when powerful low rate coding is applied. It is shown that only minor differences can be observed between the two concepts.},

New aspects arise because OFDM enables the iterative decoding structure to exploit time as well as frequency diversity of a mobile radio channel. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that iterative decoding is performed in both time and frequency domain. Besides the derivation of basic decoding algorithms, simulation results are shown for differently interleaved indoor channels. The results confirm that the iterative decoding scheme benefits from the selectivity in time as well as in frequency direction.},

abstract={This paper proposes the application of M-ary orthogonal Walsh modulation for an OFDM-CDMA uplink transmission. Beside the examination of general system properties, it is shown that decision-directed phase estimation represents a channel estimation concept suitable for the new system. The Walsh modulation can also be interpreted as a linear block code with low decoding complexity, and the paper concerns the serial concatenation of convolutional codes (CC) with Walsh modulation. New aspects arise since the CC mainly operates in time domain, and the Walsh modulation is merely arranged in frequency domain. In this context, we derive the bit specific reliability information for maximum likelihood (ML) soft decoding of the CC and discuss the trade-off between coding and spreading in case of sufficient and non-sufficient frequency interleaving. Throughout the discussions, the results are always compared with BPSK modulation performance, and it can clearly be demonstrated that M-ary Walsh modulation significantly outperforms BPSK modulation in all aspects considered in this work. Although the specific simulations are related to the European Hiperlan/2 standardization, the results are valid in general.},

abstract={We investigate the application of M-ary orthogonal modulation for multi-carrier spread spectrum (MCSS) uplink transmission over a Rayleigh fading indoor channel. Different coherent detection strategies with perfectly known channel coefficients are analyzed. Furthermore, we present a decision-directed estimation receiver to apply channel phase estimation. With decision-directed estimation no redundancy like training data is required to be transmitted. Simulation results show no performance loss for low EN0 and only a moderate degradation for high EN0/ in comparison to ideal phase equalization. Moreover, the results are always contrasted with BPSK performance. Applying M-ary orthogonal modulation is revealed to outperform BPSK with respect to bit error rate and spectral efficiency, even if ideal equalization is considered for BPSK and decision-directed estimation for M-ary orthogonal modulation. The results are generally valid, whereas in this paper, they are based on the European HIPERLAN/2-standardization. © 1998 IEEE.},

abstract={For a multi-carrier spread-spectrum (MC-SS) system, the inner spreading can be optimized by applying M-ary orthogonal modulation. In this paper, we investigate the concatenation of maximum likelihood (ML) Viterbi decoding with M-ary orthogonal modulation in a MC-SS system. The system operates over a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading indoor channel in the uplink. We first evaluate the bit specific log-likelihood ratio for ML Viterbi decoding and present an estimation of the ratio exploiting the MC technique. Furthermore, the trade-off between channel coding, M-ary orthogonal modulation and simple spreading will be considered by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results are always compared with BPSK performance and they emphasize for the concerned indoor transmission scenario that a moderate bit-error-rate can only be achieved if M-ary orthogonal modulation is employed. All simulations are related to the European Hiperlan/2 standardization whereas the results are generally valid.},

abstract={In order to combat transmission errors in digital communication systems, forward error protection based on convolutional codes and interleaving in conjunction with soft decision maximum-likelihood decoding through the Viterbi algorithm is often applied. The expected bit error rate for a given signal-to-noise ratio is generally difficult to foresee for a certain system. In this paper, we introduce a method which vividly treats the error behaviour on particular stages of the receiver, hereby allowing a coarse estimate of the overall bit error rate. Although no close mathematical results are given, several astonishing effects can easily be explained thus providing a better understanding of concatenated systems.},

abstract={Estimating the bit error rate (BER) of complex digital communication systems has often been realized by using the Monte Carlo method. For very low BER, this method requires a high computational effort. Therefore, a lot of developments in theory and application of importance sampling (IS) techniques have been done especially for AWGN channels or time-varying uniformly distributed channels. In this paper we discuss the applicability of several IS techniques for the simulation of Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels. By using the system threshold characteristic (STC) we first make an analytical statement of the IS efficiency for an AWGN and a frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channel. It is shown that due to the Rayleigh distribution the efficiency is reduced. Furthermore, the so called overbiasing effect is graphically explained and simulation results illustrate that the theoretically possible efficiencies cannot be reached in practice because of this statistic effect. Finally, the influence of time-selectivity is analyzed.},
